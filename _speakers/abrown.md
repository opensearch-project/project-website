A researcher and writer, Al Brown is a man with unflinching determination. He has fought and overcome homelessness to graduate from the City University School of Education in Seattle, WA. This future New York Times best-selling author is working on getting his first professional journal published and co-writing a separate research article with Dr. Christine Gehrke. In the meantime, he has a story to tell.
