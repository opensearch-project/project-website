A junior computer science student at Carnegie Mellon University, I have a deep psion for open-source technology and community initiatives. Through the College Contributor Initiative (CCI) program, I've gained hands-on experience and mentorship from Amazon engineers while contributing to OpenSearch. My commitment to open-source leadership and nurturing future tech enthusits positions me an ideal speaker at OpenSearchCon. I will share my journey and insights, promoting open-source collaboration and community growth.
