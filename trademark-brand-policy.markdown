## OpenSearch Trademark Policy

### September 2024

The below guidelines supplement the LF Projects, LLC Trademark Policy, available at lfprojects.org/policies/trademark-policy/. Together, they govern use of the OpenSearch trademarks. To the extent there is any inconsistency between the Policies, this OpenSearch Trademark Policy will control. If you have questions with respect to this policy or to obtain written permission for a proposed use of the OpenSearch trademarks not addressed in this policy, contact: trademarks@lfprojects.org.

## Overall Guidelines

You may use the “OpenSearch” Trademarks to refer to the OpenSearch software provided that your use is in compliance with this policy. Any other use of the OpenSearch Trademarks requires prior written permission. Overall, your use of the OpenSearch Trademarks must not be confusing, misleading, false, or damaging to the OpenSearch software, the OpenSearch Community or to the OpenSearch Trademarks themselves.

People should always know who they are dealing with, and where the software they are downloading and using came from. You may not use the OpenSearch Trademarks in any manner that implies approval or endorsement by, or association with, the OpenSearch project or the OpenSearch Community, except to identify your organization as a member of the OpenSearch Foundation. When using the OpenSearch Trademarks, your branding should be distinguishable from OpenSearch trade dress.

You may not use the OpenSearch Trademarks in a manner that may diminish or otherwise damage the goodwill in the OpenSearch Trademarks. The “OpenSearch” word mark should be used in its exact form, and not abbreviated, converted to a different word form, or otherwise modified (e.g., “OpenSearch” software is permissible, but “OPNSRCH” or “OpenSearch-ified” is not). Similarly, the OpenSearch logos should not be modified or integrated with your logos or other designs. You may create a lockup with your logo and an OpenSearch logo side by side so long as your logo is not confusingly similar to the OpenSearch logo and appears first and so long as your use complies with the Brand Guidelines and this policy.

Your use of the OpenSearch Trademarks does not transfer rights in the trademarks or goodwill to you.

## Uses that do not require permission

Provided your use complies with this policy and our [Brand Guidelines](https://opensearch.org/assets/brand/OpenSearch-Brand-Guide.pdf), you may use the OpenSearch logos to link to the OpenSearch website, to indicate that your software or service uses the OpenSearch software, in architecture diagrams to show how your software or service integrates with OpenSearch, and in presentations, social media posts (but not as your account image or avatar), whitepapers, blog posts, and similar content as a reference to the OpenSearch project itself. It should be clear what role the OpenSearch project or software plays in the context of your software or services. The OpenSearch logos should not be more prominent than your own branding.

Use only the official versions of the OpenSearch logos, available for download [here](https://opensearch.org/assets/brand/OpenSearch-logos.zip). You may transform the file format itself for ease of use and modify the colors in accordance with the [Brand Guidelines](https://opensearch.org/assets/brand/OpenSearch-Brand-Guide.pdf).

Provided your use complies with this policy, you may use the “OpenSearch” word mark to accurately reference the OpenSearch software, including on your website, in presentations and publications, at events, in advertising and marketing material, etc., for commercial and noncommercial purposes. You may use the “OpenSearch” word mark and any logos we placed on the software in connection with a redistribution of an official distribution of the OpenSearch software that has not been modified or changed in any way.

Those taking full advantage of the open source nature of the OpenSearch code may make modifications in accordance with the applicable open source license to create Derivative Works (as defined in the Apache License, version 2.0) of OpenSearch. You may use the “OpenSearch” word mark to identify or refer to your Derivative Works of OpenSearch provided (a) you include an additional identifier indicating you as the source of the Derivative Works (e.g., “Foocorp’s OpenSearch Derivative” or “Foocorp OpenSearch”), (b) you clearly identify your modifications and indicate you are the source of the modifications, (c) your use does not suggest any affiliation between OpenSearch or the OpenSearch Community and you or your Derivative Works of OpenSearch, and (d) your use of the “OpenSearch” word mark should not be more prominent than your additional identifier.

Those distributing, hosting, or otherwise taking advantage of the open source nature of the OpenSearch code may also offer services for, or software that works with, OpenSearch or Derivative Works of OpenSearch, such as cloud management services. Users should not be confused as to the source of your software or services. With that in mind, you may use the “OpenSearch” word mark to refer to services for, or software that works with, OpenSearch or Derivative Works of OpenSearch provided (a) you include an additional identifier indicating you as the source of the software or services (e.g., “Foocorp’s OpenSearch Tool” or “Foocorp OpenSearch Service”), (b) if your services or software works with Derivative Works of OpenSearch, you clearly identify the modifications and indicate the source of the modifications, (c) your use does not suggest any affiliation between OpenSearch or the OpenSearch Community and you or your work, and (d) your use of the “OpenSearch” mark should not be more prominent than your additional identifier.

You may also use the “OpenSearch” word mark to make accurate statements about compatibility and interoperability using relational phrases such as “works with,” “runs on,” “compatible with,” and the like (e.g., “Foocorp Software powered by OpenSearch” or “Foocorp Software for OpenSearch” or “Foocorp Software with OpenSearch compatibility”).

## Uses that require permission

The following uses of the OpenSearch Trademarks require our prior written approval:

●  Use of the OpenSearch logos in any way other than as expressly authorized by this Policy;

●  Use as part of a domain name, except that you may use the OpenSearch Trademarks in a subdomain name provided your use otherwise complies with this Policy (e.g., opensearch.foocorp.com);

●  Use with non-software goods or services (e.g., physical products like devices or services that do not directly use the OpenSearch software), except that you may use the OpenSearch Trademarks with a limited number of swag or promotional items not for sale such as t-shirts, lanyards, stickers, mugs, or pens; and

●  Use with software or services whose functionality does not include the ingestion, search, visualization or analysis of data.
