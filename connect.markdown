## Connect with the Community

---

There are several ways to connect with the OpenSearch community.

* OpenSearch has **[active forums](https://forum.opensearch.org/)**, which are the **fastest way to get help using, troubleshooting, and developing** with OpenSearch. As a bonus, questions and discussions on the forums are easy for others to learn from in the future. 
* If you want to **share a feature idea or submit a bug report**, open an issue in the relevant repo in **[the GitHub project](https://github.com/opensearch-project)**. 
* Join the OpenSearch Project **[Slack workspace](https://opensearch.org/slack.html)** for open communication with maintainers, contributors, and the community.
* If you want to **present** or **have a question** for an upcoming **[community meeting](https://opensearch.org/events/)**, **add a comment to the agenda** for that meeting.
* Businesses **partnering in the development and advancement** of OpenSearch can propose to **[add themselves](https://github.com/opensearch-project/project-website#adding-to-the-partners-page)** to the **[partners](https://opensearch.org/partners/)** page with a pull request.
* To **feature a plug-in or project you developed** with OpenSearch, add it to the **[community projects](https://opensearch.org/community_projects)** page with a pull request.
* Information about using the OpenSearch **brand and logo** are available on the **[Brand Guidelines](https://opensearch.org/trademark-brand-policy.html)** page.
* To report or inquire about a **potential security vulnerability**, see the **[Reporting a Vulnerability guidelines](https://github.com/opensearch-project/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md)**.
* Lastly, you can **[email](mailto:opensearch@amazon.com)** the OpenSearch maintainers with other inquiries that donâ€™t fit into any of the above categories.
