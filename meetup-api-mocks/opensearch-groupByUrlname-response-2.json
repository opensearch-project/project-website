Meetings are open-to-all and attendance is encouraged for anyone who hopes to contribute, discuss an issue, or learn more about the project. See [Triaging](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/TRIAGING.md) on OpenSearch for more details and FAQs.\n\n**Agenda**\n\n1. **Initial Gathering:** Feel free to turn on your video and engage in informal conversation. Shortly, a volunteer triage [facilitator](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/TRIAGING.md#what-is-the-role-of-the-facilitator) will begin the meeting and share their screen.\n2. **Record Attendees:** The facilitator will request attendees to share their GitHub profile links. These links will be collected and assembled into a [tag](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/TRIAGING.md#how-do-triage-facilitator-tag-comments-during-the-triage-meeting) to annotate comments during the meeting.\n3. **Announcements:** Any announcements will be made at the beginning of the meeting.\n4. **Review of New Issues:** We start by reviewing all untriaged [issues](https://github.com/search?q=label%3Auntriaged+is%3Aopen++repo%3Aopensearch-project%2FOpenSearch+&type=issues&ref=advsearch&s=created&o=desc) for the OpenSearch repo.\n5. **Attendee Requests:** An opportunity for any meeting member to request consideration of an issue or pull request.\n6. **Open Discussion:** Attendees can bring up any topics not already covered by filed issues or pull requests.\n\n**Chime Links**\n\n* Join via browser screen share: [https://chime.aws/1988437365](https://chime.aws/1988437365)\n* Join via phone (US): [+1-929-432-4463,,,1988437365#](+1-929-432-4463,,,1988437365#)\n* Join via phone (US toll-free): [+1-855-552-4463,,,1988437365#](+1-855-552-4463,,,1988437365#)",
