        "description": "Welcome to the OpenSearch Lucene Study Group!\n\n[Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) is the open-sourced search library that powers OpenSearch and many search applications large and small.\n\nWe start each meeting with a learning series, where folks can present topics and lessons on Lucene. If nobody has a topic to present, we'll do general Lucene Q&A.\n\nIn the second half of the meeting, we will review recent developments in Apache Lucene and discuss their potential impact to OpenSearch, with a particular focus on new and exciting Lucene features that we can (and should) expose through OpenSearch. Since some changes require a deep dive to fully understand, we will ask participants to volunteer for “homework” to dig deeper into changes and report back for the next meeting.\n\nStanding Agenda:\n\n* Welcome / introduction (5 minutes)\n* Lucene learning series - someone will either present a Lucene-related talk or we will do Lucene Q&A (20 minutes, recorded)\n* Review [assigned issues from last time](https://forum.opensearch.org/t/opensearch-lucene-study-group-meeting-monday-november-27th/16783) (10 minutes)\n* Review new Lucene changes and assign homework (20 minutes)\n\n*By joining the OpenSearch Lucene Study Group Meeting, you grant OpenSearch, and our affiliates the right to record, film, photograph, and capture your voice and image during the OpenSearch Community Meeting (the “Recordings”). You grant to us an irrevocable, nonexclusive, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free right and license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and translate, for any purpose, all or any part of the Recordings and Your Materials.
