## OpenSearch Syndication Protocol

At the 2005 O’Reilly Emerging Technology Conference, [Jeff Bezos showed the world](https://www.technologyreview.com/2005/03/15/231423/jeff-bezos-unveils-vertical-search-live-from-the-oreilly-e-tech-conference/) the OpenSearch syndication protocol. This protocol was born out of A9, the search arm of [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/), and allowed for the syndication of search results across services. This protocol has lived on and is still valid today. You can find more details on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSearch). This specification is currently being maintained in GitHub by an ex-A9 employee, at [github.com/dewitt/opensearch](https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch).
