Dan Widdis is a Senior Software Engineer at AWS in Bellevue. A graduate of the U. S. Naval Academy, he completed a diverse military career and transitioned into analytical roles involving running large models in a distributed computing environment. As a cloud service customer, he found Open Source software the key to adding the features he needed to optimize cloud resources.
