**Abhinav Garg** I am somebody that really enjoys programming. I try my best to diversify and try out different paradigms, having worked with scripting and web-dev, I am looking to get into low-level programming. I enjoy the idea of open source and try to spread the word about it through Open Source @ Illinois, a club on campus. I am a sophomore in Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
