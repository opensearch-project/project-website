I'm Sultan, a computer science student at Nazarbayev University and a backend developer at TSARKA. A keen interest in web technologies that sparked during high school recently brought me into the company that provides the largest cybersecurity service in Central Asia. I like exploring new technologies and learning about open-source projects. The Open Search project's College Contributor Initiative was my biggest milestone as an open-source contributor. I am happy that I have become a part of a big project that provides great solutions to companies all over the world.
