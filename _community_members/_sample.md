# The short name is used to identify related pieces of content in the site. For example it is used in the "authors" array of blog posts, and it is used in the "presenters" array for OpenSearch Conference sessions to identify who is speaking.
# The format for existing values is not normalized. In some cases it is "first-initial-of-first-name" + "last-name", or matching a GitHub username, or something all together random. What is important is that it is unique within the system.
