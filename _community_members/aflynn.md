Alastair is an enthusiastic techie with a penchant for doing things the hard way and diving into the guts of a problem. As an engineer at Canonical he operates in the office of the CTO where he works on projects in cloud computing. He has a passion for open source software and its positive social impact on the world. When not immersed in the depths of a terminal, tinkering with his home server, Alastair can be found exploring the outdoors, running or playing the piano up in Edinburgh, Scotland.
