Pietro Mele

I'm Pietro, a highly motivated software engineer with a passion for developing cutting-edge search engine solutions. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working at Adelean and the INA (French media institution responsible for preserving and promoting French audio-visual heritage), where I've gained valuable experience and honed my expertise in utilizing Elasticsearch to deliver efficient and effective search results.

My background encompasses a strong foundation in machine learning and computer vision, which allows me to incorporate intelligent algorithms into my work. I'm constantly driven to learn and expand my skillset, staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field.

Outside of work, I find great pleasure in reading, engaging in sports activities, and even coding for fun. These hobbies not only help me relax and recharge but also provide me with opportunities to explore new ideas and experiment with different programming techniques.

Overall, I am an enthusiastic and dedicated software engineer who thrives on solving complex problems and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in search engine development.
