    Welcome to the OpenSearch performance benchmarking page. You can see the results of ongoing performance testing for recent and upcoming versions of the OpenSearch software. You can view key performance metrics across different workloads with the dashboard visualizations by clicking on the dashboards link in the left column.

<h2>Why publish performance data?</h2>
<p>
    The OpenSearch Project benchmarks the performance of OpenSearch releases to measure performance stability and gather data to inform software development. As an open-source project, we make this information publicly available in order to share it with the OpenSearch community.
