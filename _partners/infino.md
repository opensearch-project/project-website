description: '<b>Goodbye Lucene, Hello Observability<b>
<br/><br/>
<b>Smarter Correlations, Better Outcomes</b>
<br/><br/>
Infino offers a schemaless, serverless managed OpenSearch service. Founded by former AWS OpenSearch engineers, we have replaced Lucene with a next-gen proprietary engine optimized for Observability use cases and internal developer platforms. 
<br/><br/>
We offer everything you have come to expect from OpenSearch except we are cheaper, faster, and with more observability features. Store logs, metrics, traces, code, tickets, etc. in one index. Query all your data at once via languages you know and love: Natural language, Query DSL, PromQL, SQL, PPL, etc. No snapshots, no mapping explosions, no astronomical bills, no slow aggregations, no cluster management. 
<br/><br/>
Save money, save time, and keep your commitments to your customers.'
