Scaling search applications with large indices can be challenging, sparking debate over the efficacy of NoSQL databases versus document storage systems. This presentation compares different approaches to store vast numbers of documents, outlining each method's pros and cons. We demonstrate these solutions through a real-world case study of a significant search engine migration project from Elasticsearch to OpenSearch.
