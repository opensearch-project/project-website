This session will guide attendees on using object storage with OpenSearch for enhanced performance, increased capacity, and reduced costs. We'll demonstrate how to set up an object storage backend, register it as a repository, back up indices via snapshots, and selectively transfer old data to another node set, eventually tiering to object storage. We will also illustrate reading data directly from the object store in real time using searchable snapshot indices, bypassing data downloads to the cluster.
