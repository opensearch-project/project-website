The belief in education as an equalizer contrasts with research showing rising U.S. economic inequality influencing educational mobility, especially for vulnerable groups. Rooted in various life spheres including education, housing, and welfare, this disparity significantly affects socio-political and economic areas. Personal experience underlines the power of parental and children's education in curbing generational poverty. With my seven years of homelessness during college, I saw a lack of community equity strategies. Educational institutions can champion social justice, improve outcomes, and break the cycle of disadvantage.
