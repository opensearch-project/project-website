The recent vector trend poses the question: &quot;Is a shift from keyword to vector essential for improving relevance?&quot; This talk discusses using the text-expansion technique in Open to enhance Keyword by overcoming its limitations. We'll discuss how to expand documents and queries with contextual features using built-in ML models or LLMs, improving Keyword 's performance and explainability without the need for complete transformation to vector . Key message: Vector isn't the only route to increased relevance.
