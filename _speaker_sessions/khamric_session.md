Monitoring and testing distributed systems can be complex and time-consuming due to their interconnected nature. Distributed tracing offers a comprehensive map to simplify system understanding. Trace-based testing further employs this data for deep integration tests. This session aims to expedite the monitoring and integration testing of your services in a near real-world environment, using OpenSearch's adaptation for the OpenTelemetry Astronomy Shop.
