WHAT IS CRYPTO?
Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are virtual currencies of the latter type: they can both be bought with traditional money as sold against traditional money, and they can be used to buy both digital and real goods and services.

In a more recent report of 2015 titled Virtual Currency Schemes – a further analysis, the ECB put forward a “second”, and largely updated, definition of virtual currencies. It defined virtual currencies as digital representations of value, not issued by a central bank, credit institution or e-money institution, which in some circumstances can be used as an alternative to money.

It also clarified that cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, constitute a decentralized bi-directional (i.e. bilateral) virtual currency.



CRYPTOCURRENCIES – BLOCKCHAIN! 
Cryptocurrencies and blockchain have become hot topics in the last couple of years.

Whilst the two are often referred to in the same sentence and are clearly linked to each other, one should never mistake one for the other.

Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology that forms the backbone of the crypto-market. 

It is the technology behind the large variety of cryptocurrencies currently in circulation. 

Its scope and field of application are, however, not limited thereto. 

As set out above, blockchain can be applied in various sectors and can have a wide array of applications. 

It is important to draw a clear line between these applications and cryptocurrencies, which are but one specific application of blockchain technology. 

Against this background, regulators need not fear of stifling innovation when tackling the subject of cryptocurrencies.


SCOPING THE CRYPTO-MARKET!
After having known a steady growth over the last couple of years, the market for cryptocurrencies has skyrocketed in 2017, appreciating more than 1,200%.113 At present, there are several hundreds of coins in circulation (with a total market capitalisation of well over  EUR 300 billion)114, and more continue to pop up on a regular basis. 

In order to fully grasp this emerging market and carry out a meaningful study, we have opted to first analyse the key properties of the best-known cryptocurrency Bitcoin and then tackle the main features of a selected number of alternative cryptocurrencies, better known as “Altcoins”. 


FUTURE AND WHY YOU NEED CRYPTO?
The S&P 500 Index is a stock market index that tracks the performance of the top 500 publicly-traded companies listed on stock exchanges in the U.S.

Crypto is going to become the 12th sector of the S&P 500. It’s going to happen over the next few years, watch.
