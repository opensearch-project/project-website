description: 'Infino offers a schemaless, serverless managed OpenSearch service. Founded by former AWS OpenSearch engineers, we have replaced Lucene with a next-gen proprietary engine optimized for Observability use cases and internal developer platforms. 
<br/><br/>
We offer what you have come to expect from OpenSearch except we are faster and with more observability features. Store logs, metrics, traces, code, tickets, etc. in one index. Query all your data at once via languages you already know: Natural language, Query DSL, PromQL, SQL, PPL, etc. Ask questions you simply could not ask with Lucene. Scale and manage your data more simply: No snapshots, no mapping explosions, no slow aggregations, and no cluster management.
<br/><br/>
Save money, save time, and keep your commitments to your customers.'
