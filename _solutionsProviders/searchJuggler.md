description: Search isn’t working? Let me help. If you’re struggling to provide great search results for your users, would like to take advantage of new AI-powered search techniques or just need expert search consulting I can help. I have over 25 years experience of search in companies such as Flax and OpenSource Connections. As The Search Juggler I'm now offering independent consulting. <br/><br/> I've spoken at OpenSearchCon on tuning e-commerce search and also given talks at many other leading search events. I am part of the team behind User Behavior Insights, a plugin for OpenSearch allowing you to record how users interact with your search results - you can use this data directly within OpenSearch to improve search quality.
