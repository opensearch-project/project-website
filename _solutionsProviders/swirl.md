SWIRL provides AI infrastructure software, installed in most any environment, that connects AI to data sources so users can have a conversation with their data without any bulk copying of data required!

- Secure: SWIRL integrates with existing Single Sign On (SSO) infrastructure. Users can never see data they aren't already authorized to see. No bulk data movement is required.

- Comprehensive: SWIRL can connect to virtually any GAI/LLM and data sources, on-premises or in cloud.

- Accurate: SWIRL's Reader LLM finds the most relevant result across sources.

- Rapid: Installing SWIRL takes about 1% of the typical vector database implementation. Get dial tone from your AI in hours -- not months or longer.

- Flexible: Integrates with your preferred LLM, including home-grown ones.

SWIRL includes zero-code integration with OpenSearch. Metasearch and find the best results across hundreds of installations, regardless of schema or version. SWIRL can even generate insights from OpenSearch results using our state-of-the-art Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
