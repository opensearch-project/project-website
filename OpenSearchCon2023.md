Get ready to join us at OpenSearchCon 2023 as we evolve what it means to be a builder. That’s right, this year’s event revolves around you—our builders—as we expand your opportunity to connect, collaborate, and grow as part of the open source community.

This free-to-attend, one-day conference brings together users, developers, and technologists across the OpenSearch Project to explore real-world successes and new applications. And don’t miss the chance to connect with peers and partners who can help you solve today’s search, analytics, and observability challenges and unlock the next phase of your OpenSearch journey.
