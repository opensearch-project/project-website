In this session we'll discuss, common attacks against AI models, extraction of data, and the risks and rewards of leveraging ML embeddings using OpenSearch's vector database. Audience members will learn about use cases, technical approaches to the problem with searchable application-layer encryption for AI vector embeddings, and likely regulatory changes coming your way.
