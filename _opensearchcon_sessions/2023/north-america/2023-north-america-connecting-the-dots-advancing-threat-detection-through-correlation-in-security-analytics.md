Today, all enterprises - large and small, across industries and geographies - are vulnerable to security threats. Security event logs often comprise of data from different sources like access logs, Netflow/VPC Flow, CloudTrail, Active directory and many more. Correlating this data is often challenging and tedious. Security Analyticsâ€™ correlation engine helps in correlating the findings from different sources. This talk explores the capabilities of OpenSearch's Security Analytics' Correlation Engine, demonstrating how it auto-correlates findings from different log categories to revolutionize threat detection. Learn how detection rules are transformed into executable OpenSearch queries, triggering threat alerts. Additionally, we'll showcase the engine's role as a Security Finding Knowledge Graph, providing holistic views of security events. Join us to strengthen your organization's defense strategies.
