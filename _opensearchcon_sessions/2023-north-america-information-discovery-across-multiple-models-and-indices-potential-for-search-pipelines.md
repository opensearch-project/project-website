OpenSearch 2.8 introduces Search Pipelines as an experimental tool to streamline user search processes. The talk will discuss using Search Pipelines to align multiple indices with information models and business workflows, transforming it into a tool meeting specific business needs. For those dealing with legacy Elasticsearch and OpenSearch in complex information ecosystems, Search Pipelines can help consolidate outputs from distributed processing, allowing teams to better manage, monitor, and maintain information fusion.
