OpenSearch has a community driven roadmap. Weâ€™ll take a look at the OpenSearch roadmap in 2024 and share key themes around which the OpenSearch contributors are innovating in. This session will give a good understanding of the technology direction that the OpenSearch project is headed. We have aggregated the innovations across key themes of StAR (Stability, Availability, Resiliency), CoPS (Cost, Performance, Scale), Ease of use, Observability/Log Analytics, Search and ML, Security, Security Analytics and Modular Architecture. As the OpenSearch project grows, we will share how OpenSearch is streamlining the process of creating a roadmap with ideas and projects that come from the community.
