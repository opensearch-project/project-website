OpenSearch is a powerful open-source search service, but its traditional ranking system doesn’t take into account user behavior. That’s where Amazon Personalize comes in! By combining OpenSearch with Amazon Personalize, we can re-rank search results based on what users have done in the past and various metadata. This means more relevant and engaging results for users, leading to higher click-through and conversion rates.

In this session, we’ll dive into how you can set up this integration, explore the benefits, and look at a real-world example from an ecommerce application. You’ll learn how to get started, what you’ll need, and some tips and tricks for making the most of personalized search in your projects. Whether you’re a developer or a business owner, this talk will show you how to make your search functionality smarter and more user-friendly.
