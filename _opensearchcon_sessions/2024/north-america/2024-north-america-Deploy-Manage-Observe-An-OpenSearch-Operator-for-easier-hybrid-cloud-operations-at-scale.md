Managing OpenSearch at scale across hybrid cloud environments poses significant challenges. It requires manual effort, advanced administrative knowledge, and familiarity with various cloud platforms. No easy task!

In this session, we'll show how we've created a simpler way. We'll introduce an open-source IaaS operator designed to simplify the deployment and management of OpenSearch for high availability, scalability, and observability. Join our session to learn about:

1. Architecture: Detailing the operator's architecture and components.
2. Operational Simplification: How the operator streamlines security, plugin and role management, and snapshotting.
3. Hybrid Cloud Deployment: Strategies for deploying OpenSearch across AWS EC2, Azure VMs, Raspberry Pis, and commodity hardware.
4. Live Demo: Illustrating the operator's capabilities with a mixed deployment fleet.
