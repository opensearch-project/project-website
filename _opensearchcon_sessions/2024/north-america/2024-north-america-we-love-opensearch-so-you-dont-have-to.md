In this engaging and insightful presentation, Abe and Rick, seasoned experts from Graylog and the IT and Security universe, will explore the innovative and practical ways, Graylog, a rapidly growing SIEM and TDIR platform leverages OpenSearch features to simplify complex database functionalities for customers. They will discuss handing essential aspects such as document storage, search language, and index templates, highlighting how these basics form the foundation of efficient data management but are not part of a modern security analysts skillset. Moving beyond the basics, they will delve into clustering, replicas, and failover strategies that ensure high availability and reliability without having the customer become an HA architect. Abe and Rick will then showcase advanced features like anomaly detection and searchable snapshots, demonstrating their critical role in enhancing data accessibility and offering layers of data and a powerful cost conversation for effective security analysis.

Real-world applications will be examined, including an online betting platform managing traffic bursts while balancing TCO, a financial organization administering local instances with monolithic load balancing across an absurd number of locations, and the external enrichment of security camera events using AI for enhanced security. All made possible by moving the Opensearch expertise to teh vendor and allowing the end customer the freedom to simply create their solution.

This presentation will provide valuable insights and potentially actionable strategies for both novice and intermediate OpenSearch users, showing how abstracting complex features allows users to focus on their core responsibilities and truly differentiate Graylog through its trusted partnership with Opensearch.
