I've played through a lot of complex survival games, but "Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead" definitely takes the cake due to its depth and intricate mechanics. Additionally, I'm often overwhelmed by the vast array of items, recipes, and enemies. This presentation introduces an innovative solution: a simple game helper / search engine powered by OpenSearch. I'm no search relevance engineer, but by leveraging the capabilities of OpenSearch, I've made an efficient, searchable database for in-game information, giving me the edge to last a little bit longer every playthrough. 

Bringing up an OpenSearch cluster is easy. I'll be starting with the docker images, indexing the game's data via the JSON straight from github, and then implementing a very simple search UI. Attendees will learn how to design and index a database tailored to the game's data, covering items, crafting recipes, and monster attributes. The presentation will also delve into building a minimal but functional interface that allows me to easily search and filter through the indexed game data.

Key features of the helper, including real-time search suggestions, detailed item views, and filtering options, will be demonstrated. We will discuss how to enhance the helper for offline use and ensure it remains a valuable resource for players. Hopefully you'll get to see the creation of a search solution from beginning to end, demonstrating just how easy it can be to index and search through your own data. 

You will eventually meet your death in this game, as is designed, but perhaps you'll survive long enough to have a bit more fun.
