Join us as we share Coursera’s experience of migrating to OpenSearch, impacting over 5 million monthly active users. In this presentation, we’ll cover the key decisions and challenges we encountered, including the integration of vector search capabilities, and our choice to leverage Coursera’s in-house ranking platform. We’ll also discuss how we conducted offline and online evaluation experiments to ensure a smooth transition and maintain search quality.
