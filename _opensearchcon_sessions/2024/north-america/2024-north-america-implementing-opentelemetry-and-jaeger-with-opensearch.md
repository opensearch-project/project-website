Observability is top of mind today, we’ll start with the basics and then jump into why OpenSearch should be part of your observability story. Today, there are so many great open source options, but the complexity of running your open source stack can be daunting. There are so many options out there today, in this talk you’ll learn why OpenSearch is the most flexible option to be a key part of your strategy. We will dive into how to instrument applications with OpenTelemetry to send logs and trace data to OpenSearch for analysis, leveraging OpenSearch Dashboards and Jaeger. Explore best practices, challenges, and real-world use cases. 

We will also cover the options for using popular metric systems like Prometheus within your OpenSearch Dashboards implementation and how OpenTelemetry can facilitate this necessary signal. We will also cover how Grafana can interoperate with OpenSearch. Then digging into architectures and learn why OpenSearch should be part of your observability stack. 

Finally, the parting thoughts will be about the future and the need for a decoupled analytics platform built on low-cost data lakes to make observability cost-effective and scalable.
