Large Language Models (LLM) have shown immense growth and advancement in the field of AI recently.LLMs can intelligently generate new content and recommendations using vast amounts of data. Famous LLMs such as GPT, BERT, PaLM, and LLaMa are revolutionising the AI industry by imitating humans.

The vector database is a new and unique database that is gaining immense popularity in the LLM space. This database effectively stores and manipulates vector data for large datasets used in machine learning use cases. There are multiple emerging vector databases in the market, one of which is the open source search and analytics suite OpenSearch.
