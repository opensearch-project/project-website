OpenSearch started semantic search strategy in 2022 and several feature has been delivered such as neueral search, hybrid search and neural sparse. In this talk we will first present the evolution path of OpenSearch semantic search. Then we will deeply dive into the latest released semantic search feature ---- Neural Sparse, where both theocratical foundation and engineering implementation will be elaborated. We will also show a simple demo of setting up neural sparse in your cluster with few steps. At last we are going to show some future plans of OpenSearch semantic search.
