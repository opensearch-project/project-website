**Part One** - Managing, Measuring, and Testing Search Relevance: Understand how working on relevance requires different thinking than other engineering problems. Learn to measure search quality, take a hypothesis-driven approach to search projects, and safely ‘fail fast’ towards ever-improving business KPIs.

**Part Two** - Engineering Relevance with OpenSearch: Explore techniques for tuning relevance that actually work. Relevance can’t be achieved by just tweaking field weights: boosting strategies, synonyms, and semantic search are discussed.

This is a paid training course provided by OpenSource Connections, suitable for search relevance engineers, search product owners, search data scientists, and other members of the search team.

OpenSearchCon attendees can register for the training at a discount of 50% off of the regular cost. Enter the code **osconsf24** during registration to attend at a cost of $425.
