At Transunion, we build products that provide insights and provide "Information for good". Global roll out of cloud native applications and products require secure and scalable observability that spans Monitoring , Alerting , Logging and Traceability across Microservices and Systems/Stacks. In this presentation we would like to share the proven approaches that helped us scale Opensearch for Operational and Business Intelligence generation that is leading to Self healing preventive and optimization across various dimensions including cost and proactive incident management.

In this presentation , In this presentation we would like to share the proven approaches that helped us scale Opensearch for Operational Intelligence  that led to Proactive , Self healing delivery through end to end telemetry across multiple dimensions including aggregated cost, Usage based behavior proactive incident management and charting the course towards Business Intelligence & lessons learnt in 
1. Scaling Opensearch across global regions for cloud native applications. 2. Challenges & Approaches adopted in cohabiting, migrating from commercial technologies to OpenSearch 3. Observations and optimizations in scaling from Operational Intelligence to Business Intelligence services leveraging Gen AI practices including Anamoly detection ,  Business pattern driven adaptive self learning of microservices from one region onto another"
