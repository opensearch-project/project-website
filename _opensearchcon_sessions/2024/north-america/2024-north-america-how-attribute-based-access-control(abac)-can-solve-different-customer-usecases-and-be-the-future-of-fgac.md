The presentation will be slides only. The slides will entail different ways the customers can use the ABAC to achieve their solutions for their varied use-cases. This feature just a thought currently, going to raise a RFC this week and aligns with the RFC Theme for security. The ABAC can make the current FGAC much more dynamic based on multiple attributes -> temporal, spatial, role based, profile based, limit based, etc.
In the future it can be some language like OPA, etc. and then also be drag and drop based which can be configured graphically.

The Authorization engine also can be made more robust, extensive and decentralized with well known industry standards by introducing components like  PAP(Policy Administration Point) - place where all the policies are kept and managed, PDP (Policy Decision Point) - place where the decision of a action is calculated or infered based on all the policies applicable for that user and resource with an ALLOW or DENY and finally PEP(Policy Enforcement Point) - this is the actual enforcement point which intercepts the incoming request and enforces the AuthZ based on above decision.
