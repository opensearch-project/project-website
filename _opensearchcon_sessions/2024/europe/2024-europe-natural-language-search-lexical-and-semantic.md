When we work with information systems, we capture information in text and find information with text queries. Advances in AI have made it possible to move from word-to-word matching to something like meaning-to-meaning matching. Learn how search and OpenSearch unlock the meaning in your information.

This session is foundational, covering why we search, and how we search to retrieve the best results. I will cover the core search algorithm, BM25 scoring, vectors (dense and sparse), LLMs, embedding generation and the neural and kNN plugins, exact, and approximate scoring
