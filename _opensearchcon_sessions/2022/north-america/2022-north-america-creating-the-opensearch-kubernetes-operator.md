The OpenSearch Kubernetes Operator was the product of a unique, international collaboration by the OSS community. We’ll cover everything you need to know about the Operator, including installation, hardware requirements and environment compatibility, and best practices. You’ll also learn about features such as out-of-the-box security, auto-scaling, upgrading sessions, blue-green deployments, and more.
