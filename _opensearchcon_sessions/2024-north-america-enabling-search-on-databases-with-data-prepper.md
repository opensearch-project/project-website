OpenSearch is widely used for its fast search and analytics capabilities. OpenSearch enables users to analyze their data in real time. Many databases do not have the extensive analytic and search capabilities provided by OpenSearch, and Data Prepper is enabling search use cases for these databases by keeping them in sync with OpenSearch indexes.
