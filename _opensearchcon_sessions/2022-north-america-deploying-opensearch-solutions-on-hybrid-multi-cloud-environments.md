This session will showcase a cloud-vendor agnostic alternative to deploying and operating OpenSearch in a hybrid multi-cloud scenario. An open-source solution is used to achieve this, the Charmed Operators. The end goal is to empower developers to use and operate OpenSearch solutions in production, as well as lowering the adoption barrier.
