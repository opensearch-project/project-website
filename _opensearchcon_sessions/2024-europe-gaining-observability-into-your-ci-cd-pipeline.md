We all know that observability is a must-have for operating systems in production. But we often neglect our own backyard - our software release process. That was our mistake, which led us to wasting time and energy in handling failures in the CI/CD pipeline, and made our Developer-on-Duty on-call shifts tedious.

In this talk Horovits will share how the engineering team at his company built effective observability into their CI/CD pipeline using intelligent data collection, dashboarding and alerting with OpenSearch and other open source stack, to boost their response to failures and improve their engineers' quality of life on the way.

This talk will give practical guidance on how to improve observability into your CI/CD pipeline. Whether you use Jenkins like we do, or other CI/CD tools, you’ll learn how to augment them and reach higher productivity. Horovits will also discuss a new initiative he leads to standardize CI/CD observability under the OpenTelemetry project. Join us to learn more.
