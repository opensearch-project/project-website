# OpenSearch.org website

Opensearch.org is now hosted by the Linux Foundation. This repo contains the source for the [opensearch.org](https://opensearch.org/) website as it existed as a statically generated Jekyll site. It is now a content repository instead of a code repository. 

PRs are still used for intake and editorial.
