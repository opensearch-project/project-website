This site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). You can build the site and make it available on a local server via `docker-compose up -d`, or by installing all the dependencies on your local environment as follows.

1. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/), then run `bundle install`.
2. Build and start Jekyll with `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
3. Browse the site at [`http://127.0.0.1:4000/`](http://127.0.0.1:4000/).

Alternatively, build the site with `bundle exec jekyll build`. The HTML output is generated into `/_site`.
