Search is a core component of many business-critical systems. For any search use case, relevance is keyâ€”some search results are better than others, and a variety of processes can be applied to determine which results should rise to the top. OpenSearch gives you a vast array of built-in functionality and integrated tools so you can tune your processes to your data and maximize the relevance and value of your search results.

With OpenSearch, performance and scalability are built in, so you can manage massive volumes of information while benefiting from the flexibility and cost efficiency of an open-source platform. For document and e-commerce use cases or for embedding search within applications, OpenSearch offers search practitioners a high-performance, highly configurable foundation for search solutions that evolve with your organization, your users, and your data.
