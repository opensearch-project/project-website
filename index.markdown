**Welcome to OpenSearch**


OpenSearch is a community-driven, Apache 2.0-licensed open source search and analytics suite that makes it easy to ingest, search, visualize, and analyze data. Developers build with OpenSearch for use cases such as application search, log analytics, data observability, data ingestion, and more. 


OpenSearch consists of a data store and search engine (OpenSearch), and a visualization and user interface (OpenSearch Dashboards). Users can extend the functionality of OpenSearch with a selection of plugins that enhance search, security, performance analysis, machine learning, and more.


To get started with OpenSearch, visit our [downloads](https://opensearch.org/downloads.html) page, check out our [documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest), and explore the project on [Github](https://github.com/opensearch-project).


**Open source flexibility**


As a fully open source solution, OpenSearch offers you the freedom to modify, extend, monetize, and resell the product as you see fit, as well as the flexibility to deploy on a variety of infrastructures. At the same time, the OpenSearch project provides a secure, high-quality search and analytics suite with a rich [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/opensearch-project/projects/1) of new and innovative functionality. 


**A community-driven approach**


OpenSearch is built with your input. The project is maintained and advanced by a [community](https://forum.opensearch.org/), including a network of [partners](https://opensearch.org/partners/), and is open to contribution. As noted in the project’s [principles for development](https://opensearch.org/about.html#principles-for-development), great open source software is built together, with a diverse community of contributors. We invite you to [get involved](https://opensearch.org/connect.html).
