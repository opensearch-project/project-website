## How to verify signatures for downloadable artifacts

Download our PGP key using the link below and import it. 

If youâ€™re using gpg, you just need to run: 

```
gpg --import /path/to/key
````

You can then verify the signature by downloading it into the same directory where you downloaded the tarball, and running:

```
gpg --verify /path/to/signature /path/to/tarball
```

It should show a good signature signed by opensearch@amazon.com.

Our current PGP key fingerprint is `C5B7 4989 65EF D1C2 924B  A9D5 39D3 1987 9310 D3FC`
