OpenSearch is a community-driven, open-source search and analytics suite used by developers to ingest, search, visualize, and analyze data.
 
The OpenSearch project was [first announced in January 2021](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/stepping-up-for-a-truly-open-source-elasticsearch/) as an open-source fork of Elasticsearch and Kibana to provide a secure, high-quality, fully open-source search and analytics suite with a rich feature roadmap. [In July 2021](https://opensearch.org/blog/updates/2021/07/opensearch-general-availability-announcement/), the project released OpenSearch 1.0 for production under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) (ALv2), with the codebase [published to GitHub](https://github.com/opensearch-project) and open to contribution from the OpenSearch community.
 
Since the start of the project, the OpenSearch community has grown to 100s of contributors, 1000s of pull requests, 1000s of issues closed, and is organized across 65 repositories. In March 2022, OpenSearch [released version 1.3](https://opensearch.org/blog/releases/2022/03/launch-announcement-1-3-0/) of the project with major updates to index state management, observability, visualization, and more. A comprehensive project roadmap is maintained [here](https://github.com/orgs/opensearch-project/projects/1).
 
The latest release of OpenSearch is available for [download here](https://opensearch.org/downloads.html).
 
## Principles for development ##

When we (the contributors) are successful, OpenSearch will be:
 
### Great software. ###
If it doesn’t solve your problems, everything else is moot. It’s going to be software you love to use.
 
### Open source like we mean it. ###
We are invested in this being a successful open-source project for the long term. It’s all Apache 2.0. There’s no Contributor License Agreement. Easy.
 
### A level playing field. ###
We will not tweak the software so that it runs better for any vendor (including AWS) at the expense of others. If this happens, call it out and we will fix it as a community.
 
### Used everywhere. ###
Our goal is for as many people as possible to use it in their business, their software, and their projects. Use it however you want. Surprise us!
 
### Made with your input. ###
We will ask for public input on direction, requirements, and implementation for any feature we build.
 
### Open to contributions. ###
Great open-source software is built together, with a diverse community of contributors. If you want to get involved at any level - big, small, or huge - we will find a way to make that happen. We don’t know what that looks like yet, and we look forward to figuring it out together.
 
### Respectful, approachable, and friendly. ###
This will be a community where you will be heard, accepted, and valued, whether you are a new or experienced user or contributor.
 
### A place to invent. ###
You will be able to innovate rapidly. This project will have a stable and predictable foundation that is modular, making it easy to extend.
