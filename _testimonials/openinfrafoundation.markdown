We in the OpenInfra community are energized by how OpenSearch has engaged with the vision of an open development model, based on the four principles of open source, open design, open development, and open community. And, OpenSearchâ€™s support as an infrastructure donor to the OpenStack community is a tangible proof point of how our communities are working together to deliver open source software that runs in production.
