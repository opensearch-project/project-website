We embrace cloud technologies that are built on open-source services and technologies so that our customer use cases are well supported and agnostic of vendors. Earlier, we relied centrally on Elasticsearch for source tracking, content search, and log analytics because of its ability to ingest and log large volumes of data. With the launch of OpenSearch, we can serve customers across industries through its additional capabilities such as Advanced security and alerting, KNN Search, and anomaly detection. It also facilitates faster decision-making for the stakeholders through its integrated visualization tool, OpenSearch Dashboards. In conclusion, we're excited to leverage OpenSearch in our future engagements.
