Make plans to join the first-ever Unconference and come ready to pitch 
your favorite speaking topic! This is an opportunity for the community to 
come together and kick off OpenSearchCon with an action-packed afternoon 
of sharing and discovery. With no pre-planned talks, what you want to hear 
about will be determined by you and your fellow conference-goers.

### Attendees/Speakers

This is a first-come, first-served event; the room holds up to 100 individuals 
and anyone registered for OpenSearchCon is welcome to attend until the 
room is full. We advise you to show up a little early to make sure you get 
your spot.

Each speaker has 15 minutes to do with as they see fit! Want to talk for 10 
minutes and have 5 minutes of questions? Great! Have a lot to say and want 
to talk for the whole 15? That works too! Are you a maintainer and want to 
hold a lightning round of questions with the audience? Fantastic! You get the
picture. Just be mindful of your 15 minutes!

### Voting

At 1:00 PM, each attendee will receive a card and three gold-star stickers. 
Those who would like to give a talk will write their title and brief description 
on the card, put their name on the back, and post them to the board for 
voting.

At 1:10, you&apos;ll have 10 minutes to walk the board and place a gold star on 
one of the talks you would like to hear. Two rules: please do not vote for 
yourself, and, if a card already has all 5 spaces filled, you can no longer vote 
for it.

At 1:20, Nick, Kris, and Charlotte will collect and sort the cards, then select the day's 
talks from the cards receiving the most votes while ensuring the widest 
arrangement of topics are covered. 

At 1:30, we will return the cards to the wall in the order each talk will be 
given. Be ready to talk and participate!
