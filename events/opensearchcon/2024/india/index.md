## Join us in Bengaluru on June 26th 2024 for OpenSearchCon 2024 India.

The OpenSearch community continues to expand, always welcoming new individuals, organizations, and partners into the fold, and OpenSearchCon is where the community comes together.

Registration is now closed.

As always, what makes OpenSearchCon a success are the compelling stories and educational insights shared by our community. The Call for Presentations (CfP) for OpenSearchCon India is now closed.

## What is OpenSearchCon?
OpenSearchCon is the annual conference for the OpenSearch Project community. OpenSearchCon brings the community together to learn, connect, and collaborate.

This annual event aims to educate and inspire with presentation sessions, participant-driven meetings, and exhibits and demonstrations from OpenSearch Project partners.

Users, administrators, and developers come to OpenSearchCon to explore solutions to real-world problems, network with their peers, and take a look into the future of search, analytics, and observability applications.
