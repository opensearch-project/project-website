## What is OpenSearchCon?
OpenSearchCon is the annual conference for the OpenSearch Project community. OpenSearchCon brings the community together to learn, connect, and collaborate.

This annual event aims to educate and inspire with presentation sessions, participant-driven meetings, and exhibits and demonstrations from OpenSearch Project partners.

Users, administrators, and developers come to OpenSearchCon to explore solutions to real-world problems, network with their peers, and take a look into the future of search, analytics, and observability applications.
