OpenSearchCon India 2024 welcomes ideas for presentations on topics the OpenSearch community cares about. We invite the community to submit your best ideas and join us for a great conference in Bangalore on June 26th, 2024. We are actively seeking a diverse set of developers/community members and encourage everyone to send in their ideas.

## What the OpenSearch community is interested in

* **Search**: Connect with search and relevance practitioners who want to share ideas on how they have best used OpenSearch in production for their search workloads as well as deep dives into search, and new and novel techniques for delivering better relevance. This track also covers using vector search capability of OpenSearch for Gen AI applications and Hybrid search, Semantic search, RAG, Neural search, Multimodal search etc.
* **Analytics, Security, and Observability**: OpenSearch is being extensively used in log analytics, security, and observability applications. We want to hear from you how you solved problems and provide solutions in these domains at scale. What enabled success and how can others achieve the same outcomes? How using OpenSearch we can protect our organization’s infrastructure?
* **OpenSearch Community**: One of the wonderful things about working in open source is the backing of a community of people who believe in our mission at OpenSearch. We would love to hear how you have been contributing to our vibrant community as well as how we can contribute to OpenSearch or open source, how to foster community engagement, how to build the next generation of open source leaders — virtually anything that inspires a community of open source technology enthusiasts is open for consideration here.

## How long for each session

* **Presentation**: 40 minutes.
* **Short presentation**: 20 minutes.

## Abstract, Title, & Description

Please submit both an abstract, title, and description for your talk.

* **Title**: What is going on the front of your presentation? Something informative to ensure the audience knows what they will be learning about.
* **Abstract**: The abstract is a short summary of the topic of your talk, and essentially serves as a tl;dr for your presentation. It will be displayed on our session list, and is a first introduction of your session to the audience.
* **Description**: The session description is a detailed outline of your talk, explaining why your topic is relevant, what you will be talking about and what the audience will learn.

This information will help the reviewers to get a good impression of your session and judge it accordingly, and both will be publicly visible when your talk is accepted.

CfP ends on **May 12th, 2024 at 23:59 IST**.
