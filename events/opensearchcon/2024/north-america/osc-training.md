New for OpenSearchCon North America, renowned search relevance experts and OpenSearch partners [OpenSource Connections](https://opensourceconnections.com/) will lead a one-day intensive training course, "**Think Like a Relevance Engineer with OpenSearch**," scheduled for Thursday, September 26 from 9:00am to 5:30pm at the Hilton Union Square San Francisco. The course is broken into two parts designed to help search practitioners advance search relevance using OpenSearch.

**Part One** - Managing, Measuring, and Testing Search Relevance: Understand how working on relevance requires different thinking than other engineering problems. Learn to measure search quality, take a hypothesis-driven approach to search projects, and safely ‘fail fast’ towards ever-improving business KPIs. 

**Part Two** - Engineering Relevance with OpenSearch: Explore techniques for tuning relevance that actually work. Relevance can’t be achieved by just tweaking field weights: boosting strategies, synonyms, and semantic search are discussed.

This is a paid training course provided by OpenSource Connections, suitable for search relevance engineers, search product owners, search data scientists, and other members of the search team.

OpenSearchCon attendees can register for the training at a discount of 50% off of the regular cost. Enter the code **osconsf24** during registration to attend at a cost of $425.
