### What is OpenSearchCon?

OpenSearchCon is the annual conference that brings the OpenSearch community together to learn, connect, and collaborate. This year, we expanded OpenSearchCon beyond North America with the addition of events in [Europe](https://opensearch.org/events/opensearchcon/2024/europe/index.html) and [India](https://opensearch.org/events/opensearchcon/2024/india/index.html). OpenSearchCon aims to educate and inspire with presented sessions, participant-driven meetings, and exhibits and demonstrations from OpenSearch Project partners. Users, administrators, and developers come to OpenSearchCon to explore solutions to real-world problems, network with their peers, and take a look into the future of search, observability, and security applications.

We have watched OpenSearchCon North America grow from its humble beginnings as a single-track, one-day event to a three-day, multi-track open source community experience that includes an unconference, training and workshops, a partner round table, and other exciting networking and partner opportunities.

We hope to see  you in San Francisco!
