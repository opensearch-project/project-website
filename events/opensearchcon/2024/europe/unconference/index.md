We had a fantastic time in Seattle last year, so we're bringing the Unconference to Berlin!
Make plans to join us and come ready to pitch 
your favorite speaking topic! This is an opportunity for the community to 
come together and kick off OpenSearchCon Europe with an action-packed afternoon 
of sharing and discovery. With no pre-planned talks, what you want to hear 
about will be determined by you and your fellow conference-goers.

### Attendees/Speakers

This is a first-come, first-served event; the room holds up to 100 individuals 
and anyone registered for OpenSearchCon is welcome to attend until the 
room is full. We advise you to show up a little early to make sure you get 
your spot.

Each speaker has 15 minutes to do with as they see fit! Want to talk for 10 
minutes and have 5 minutes of questions? Great! Have a lot to say and want 
to talk for the whole 15? That works too! Are you a maintainer and want to 
hold a lightning round of questions with the audience? Fantastic! You get the
picture. Just be mindful of your 15 minutes!

### Voting

At 1:00 PM, each attendee will receive a card and three gold-star stickers. 
Those who would like to give a talk will write their title and brief description 
on the card, put their name on the back, and post them to the board for 
voting.

At 1:10, you&apos;ll have 10 minutes to walk the board and place a gold star on 
one of the talks you would like to hear. Two rules: please do not vote for 
yourself, and, if a card already has all 5 spaces filled, you can no longer vote 
for it.

At 1:20, Kris and a lucky volunteer will collect and sort the cards, then select the day's 
talks from the cards receiving the most votes while ensuring the widest 
arrangement of topics are covered. 

At 1:30, we will return the cards to the wall in the order each talk will be 
given. Be ready to talk and participate!
