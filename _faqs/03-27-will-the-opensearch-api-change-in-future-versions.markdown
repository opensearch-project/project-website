question: Will the OpenSearch API change in future versions?
category: Upgrading to OpenSearch
---

All future OpenSearch 1.x releases will be backwards compatible with open source Elasticsearch 7.10. If functionality requires a breaking change, we will introduce a new major version of OpenSearch and provide tooling to make migrating to the new major version simple. When new features require adding APIs, we will work with the community to add support for these features in popular clients.
