question: What will your governance model be? Are you looking at any foundations?

At this time, there is not a plan to move OpenSearch in to a foundation. As we work together in the open, we expect to uncover the best ways to collaborate and empower all interested stakeholders to share in decision making. Cultivating the right governance approach for an open source project requires thoughtful deliberation with the community. Weâ€™re confident that we can find the best approach together over time. For now, AWS is the steward of OpenSearch. The principles of development define the guidelines for how decisions about the project are made. These principles will continue to be iterated and refined based on feedback.
