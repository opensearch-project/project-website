question: Do Elasticsearch clients like Logstash and Beats work with OpenSearch?
category: General
---

Since OpenSearch is wire-compatible with Elasticsearch 7.10, any clients that currently work
with Elasticsearch 7.10 should also work with OpenSearch. For details specific about open
source Logstash and Beats compatibility please see the [documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/clients/agents-and-ingestion-tools/index/#compatibility-matrices).

Please report any issues you experience with these clients
or other clients in our project [GitHub issues](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues).

For more questions related to upgrading clients, see [upgrading FAQs](#c3).
