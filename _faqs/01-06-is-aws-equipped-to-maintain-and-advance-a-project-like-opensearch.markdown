question: Is AWS equipped to maintain and advance a project like OpenSearch?
category: General
---

When AWS decides to offer a service based on an open source project, we ensure that we are equipped and prepared to maintain it ourselves, if necessary. We bring years of experience working with Elasticsearch and Kibana codebases and have made upstream code contributions to both Elasticsearch and Apache Lucene (the core search library that Elasticsearch is built on). We have added several features in open source like security, alerting, anomaly detection, index state management, and trace analytics that are widely used and deployed in production by our community and customers. We are well equipped to maintain and advance the project ourselves. Also, the community-backed codebase will help accelerate new innovations and will allow everyone to move faster in improving stability, scalability, resiliency, and performance. Already [many organizations](/partners/) including SAP, CapitalOne, RedHat, Logz.io, Aiven.io, Bonsai, Logit.io, Search Guard, and BAInsight have publicly backed OpenSearch.
