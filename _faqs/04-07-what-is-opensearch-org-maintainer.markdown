category: Community and Collaboration

[Maintainers](https://github.com/opensearch-project/.github/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md#maintainer-responsibilities) are active and visible members of the community, and have [maintain-level permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization) on a repository. They use those privileges to serve the community and evolve the software in the repository they maintain. Maintainer responsibilities can be found in the OpenSearch .github repository [maintainer file](https://github.com/opensearch-project/.github/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md).
