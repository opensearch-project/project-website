question: What are the benefits of moving a project under the OpenSearch Project GitHub organization?
category: Community and Collaboration

The main benefits include increased visibility, and if you no longer can or want to maintain the project some day, the project will help find new maintainers to transition the ownership. Everything else remains the same, including that you retain the administrator permissions of your GitHub repository
