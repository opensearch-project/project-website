question: What are my security obligations when developing in OpenSearch Project Github organization repositories?

Security is your number one priority. Maintainer's Github keys must be password protected securely and any reported security vulnerabilities are addressed before features or bugs. Note that repositories in the OpenSearch GitHub organization are monitored and supported 24/7 by Amazon Security, see [Reporting a Vulnerability](https://github.com/opensearch-project/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for details.
