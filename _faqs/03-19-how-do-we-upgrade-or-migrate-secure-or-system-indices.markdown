question: How do I upgrade or migrate secure or system indices?
category: Upgrading to OpenSearch

There is no need to migrate secure or system indices for the upgrade to OpenSearch 1.0. This is because theses indices are not being renamed. In future upgrades, index aliases or migrations may be introduced for secure or system indices.
