question: What is an OpenSearch Project Github organization repository administrator?
category: Community and Collaboration
---

An admin owns stewardship of the repository and its settings. Admins have [admin-level permissions on a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization). Use those privileges to serve the community and protect the repository as follows. Administrator responsibilities can be found in the OpenSearch .github repository [admins file](https://github.com/opensearch-project/.github/blob/main/ADMINS.md).
