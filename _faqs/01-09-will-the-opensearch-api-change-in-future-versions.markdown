question: Will the OpenSearch API change in future versions?
category: General
---
All future OpenSearch 1.x releases will be backwards compatible with Elasticsearch 7.10, although some APIs will be deprecated. If functionality requires a breaking change, we will introduce a new major version of OpenSearch and provide tooling to make migrating to the new major version simple. When new features require adding APIs, we will work with the community to add support for these features in popular clients.

For more details on deprecated APIs, see [upgrading FAQs](#c3).
