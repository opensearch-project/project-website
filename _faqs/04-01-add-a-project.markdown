question: How do I add a project to the community project page on opensearch.org?
category: Community and Collaboration
---

To add a project:

* Fork the [opensearch website repository](https://github.com/opensearch-project/project-website).
* Create a branch. The recommended naming convention is `adds-<your project name>-to-community-projects`
* Add a [markdown file](https://github.com/opensearch-project/project-website/blob/main/_community_projects/_sample.md) for your project to .`/_community_projects/your-project.md`
* Last create a pull request and one of the website maintainers will review it and work with you to merge it.

To see an example pull request, look [here](https://github.com/opensearch-project/project-website/pull/186)).
