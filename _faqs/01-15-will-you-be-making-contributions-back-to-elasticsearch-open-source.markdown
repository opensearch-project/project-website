No. Open source Elasticsearch development ended with 7.10 when it was moved to a non-open source license. OpenSearch software will move forward according to the needs of the community. That said, all OpenSearch software built for its customers and the community is released under the ALv2 license and we welcome anyone to use the software under the ALv2 terms and conditions.
