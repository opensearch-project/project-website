question: Can I use OpenSearch plugins with the proprietary Elastic stack?
category: Tools and Plugins

The plugins are tested to work with OpenSearch. They have not been tested with Elasticâ€™s proprietary software. As these plugins are open source, we do welcome anyone who wants to test them out with the Elastic Stack. However, we do not plan to invest in making the OpenSearch plugins work on the Elastic stack.
