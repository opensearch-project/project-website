# All operations of service foo are sampled with probability 0.8 except for operations op1 and op2 which are probabilistically sampled with probabilities 0.2 and 0.4 respectively.
# All operations for service bar are rate-limited at 5 traces per second.
# Any other service will be sampled with probability 1 defined by the default_strategy.
