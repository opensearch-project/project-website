    A note to maintainers who might wonder why such a thing as this would exist.
    Ease of content authoring using only Markdown and Front Matter as a goal
    is at times at odds with sophisticated designs. So, here's a kludge
    to allow that to happen where necessary.
{% endcomment %}
{%- if include.source_selector and include.insert_before_selector -%}
<script type="module">
    const sourceSelector = "{{ include.source_selector }}";
    const insertBeforeSelector = "{{ include.insert_before_selector }}";
    const sourceNode = document.querySelector(sourceSelector);
    const targetNode = document.querySelector(insertBeforeSelector);
    const targetParent = targetNode?.parentNode;
    targetParent?.insertBefore?.(sourceNode, targetNode);
</script>
{%- endif -%}
