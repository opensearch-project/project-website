<p>The SQL CLI component in OpenSearch is a stand-alone Python application and can be launched by a 'wake' word <code>opensearchsql</code>.</p>
<p>It only supports <a href="https://docs-beta.opensearch.org/search-plugins/sql/index/" rel="nofollow">OpenSearch SQL Plugin</a>.
    You must have the OpenSearch SQL plugin installed in your OpenSearch instance to connect.
    Users can run this CLI from Linux or Windows, and they can connect to any valid OpenSearch endpoint, such as Amazon OpenSearch Service.</p>

Please visit <a href="https://pypi.org/project/opensearchsql/">PyPI</a> for more details.
