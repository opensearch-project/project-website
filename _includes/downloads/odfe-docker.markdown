These steps will setup a two node cluster of Elasticsearch plus Kibana:

1. Download [docker-compose.yml](/samples/opendistro/docker-compose.yml) into your desired directory
2. Run `docker compose up`
3. Have a nice coffee while everything is downloading and starting up
4. Navigate to [https://localhost:5601/](https://localhost:5601/) for Kibana
5. Login with the default username (`admin`) and password (`admin`)
