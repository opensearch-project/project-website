name: Kubernetes Logging stack using Opensearch
description: This helm chart deploys a scalable containerized logging stack, enabling log observability for kubernetes applications with Opensearch. The deployment may take various forms, from a single node setup usable for a local development up to scaled multi nodes opensearch deployments used in production environments. It is an easy way to provision a managed Opensearch cluster with optional kafka brokers, fluentbits and fluentd(s) supplying additional initialization steps for the various components.
