**Jinen Setpal** 

I’m a third-year undergraduate @ Purdue University, pursuing a B.Sc in Data Science. I’m applying for PhD programs with Summer/Fall 2024 intake!

My primary research interest lies at the intersection of ML theory and intrinsic interpretability; I aim to study and develop methods for leveraging intuitive biases that enable models to find parameters that produce emergent learning while remaining interpretable by design.
