In this free, half-day workshop, you’ll learn how to use OpenSearch to search data and analyze log data. You’ll learn how to deploy an OpenSearch cluster on Kubernetes and a simple container application for searching. Experiment with search and search relevance. Try out the neural plugin to generate and search with kNN. Pull log and metric data, send it to OpenSearch to visualize the performance of the application, and use the OpenSearch observability capabilities to debug issues.

### Upon completion of this hands-in lab, you’ll have a strong understanding of how to:

-   Create and manage Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service clusters.
-   Use  [OpenSearch helm charts](https://github.com/opensearch-project/helm-charts/blob/main/README.md)  to deploy OpenSearch and OpenSearch dashboards.
-   Utilize OpenSearch query language,  [Query DSL](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/query-dsl/index/), to search data.
-   Employ OpenSearch  [Trace Analytics](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/monitoring-plugins/trace/index/) to help you find and fix problems with your application and infrastructure.
-   Explore vector-based, semantic search after learning the fundamentals of the OpenSearch Neural plugin.
-   Build visualizations and dashboards to monitor your application in near-real-time.

Attendees will be provided with an AWS account and pre-provisioned resources to participate in the lab, along with wifi and power connection to support their lab experience. Course and login information will be emailed to you prior to the start of the hands-on workshop.
