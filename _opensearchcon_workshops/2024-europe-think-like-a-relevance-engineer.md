The training is a one-day intensive course based on Think Like a Relevance Engineer (TLRE) OpenSearch and taught by the team at OpenSource Connections.

- Part One - Managing, Measuring, and Testing Search Relevance: Understand how working on relevance requires different thinking than other engineering problems. We teach you to measure search quality, take a hypothesis-driven approach to search projects, and safely ‘fail fast’ towards ever improving business KPIs.
- Part Two - Engineering Relevance with OpenSearch: This part of the training demonstrates relevance tuning techniques that actually work. Relevance can’t be achieved by just tweaking field weights: boosting strategies, synonyms, and semantic search are discussed.
