The OpenSearch Project has a public Slack to enable brainstorming, code reviews, and other ad hoc collaboration discussions with the community.

In addition to the [OpenSearch Code of Conduct](https://opensearch.org/codeofconduct.html), the following are guiding principles for the new Slack workspace:

* Open Communication – To facilitate better sharing of information, ideas, and announcements, all communication is encouraged to happen in the open project channels.
* Safe and Inclusive – The workspace strives to be a safe and inclusive environment where everyone feels comfortable participating.
* Level Playing Field – All project maintainers and collaborators are created equal; feedback and proposals will be fully considered based on their benefits to the overall community—not based on who proposed them.
* Full Transparency – All project maintainers are encouraged to use the Slack workspace along with the [discussion forums](https://forum.opensearch.org/) and [GitHub project](http://github.com/opensearch-project) repositories for all communication in order to discourage any closed-source discussions or development decisions.
* No Sales Pitches – The OpenSearch Project Slack workspace is a place to discuss development of the project—not a place to sell things.

Contributors, maintainers, and community members can use this communication channel to collaborate.
