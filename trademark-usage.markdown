This Policy provides guidelines for use of the “OpenSearch” name and logo (the “OpenSearch Trademarks”) to identify the OpenSearch software. Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates (“Amazon”) strives to be a steward of the OpenSearch brand for the entire OpenSearch Community and is the owner of the OpenSearch Trademarks. As such, the law obligates us to police and protect the trademarks. Therefore, we require use of the OpenSearch Trademarks to be in accordance with this policy. Indeed, our own use is designed to be consistent with this Policy.

Our goal is to ensure on behalf of the OpenSearch Community that the OpenSearch Trademark remain reliable indicators of quality and security while also permitting community members, software distributors and others to discuss OpenSearch and to accurately describe their products’ affiliation with OpenSearch or the OpenSearch
Community, as well as exercise their rights given OpenSearch’s open source nature. Note that this policy only applies to use of the OpenSearch Trademarks.

## Overall Guidelines

You may use the “OpenSearch” word mark to refer to the OpenSearch software provided that your use is in compliance with this policy. Any other use of the OpenSearch Trademarks, including any logos, requires prior written permission.

Overall, your use of the OpenSearch Trademarks must not be confusing, misleading, false, or damaging to the OpenSearch software, the OpenSearch Community or to the OpenSearch Trademarks themselves. 

People should always know who they are dealing with, and where the software they are downloading and using came from. You may not use the OpenSearch Trademarks in any manner that implies approval or endorsement by, or association with, the OpenSearch project or the OpenSearch Community. When using the OpenSearch Trademarks, your branding should be distinguishable from OpenSearch trade dress.

You may not use the OpenSearch Trademarks in a manner that may diminish or otherwise damage the goodwill in the OpenSearch Trademarks. The “OpenSearch” word mark should be used in its exact form, and not abbreviated or combined with any other word or words (e.g., “OpenSearch” software rather than “OPNSRCH” or “OpenSearch-ified”).

Your use of the OpenSearch Trademarks does not transfer rights in the trademarks or goodwill to you.

## Uses that do not require permission

Provided your use complies with this policy, you may use the “OpenSearch” word mark to accurately reference the OpenSearch software, including on your website, in presentations and publications, at events, in advertising and marketing material, etc., for commercial and noncommercial purposes.

You may use the “OpenSearch” word mark and any logos we placed on the software in connection with a redistribution of an official distribution of the OpenSearch software that has not been modified or changed in any way.

Those taking full advantage of the open source nature of the OpenSearch code may make modifications in accordance with the applicable open source license to create Derivative Works (as defined in the Apache License, version 2.0) of OpenSearch. You may use the “OpenSearch” word mark to refer to your Derivative Works of OpenSearch provided (a) you include an additional identifier indicating you as the source of the Derivative Works (e.g., “Foocorp’s OpenSearch Derivative”), (b) you clearly identify your modifications and indicate you are the source of the modifications, (c) your use does not suggest any affiliation between OpenSearch or the OpenSearch Community and you or your Derivative Works of OpenSearch, and (d) your use of the “OpenSearch” word mark should not be more prominent than your additional identifier.

Those taking advantage of the open source nature of the OpenSearch code may also offer services for, or software that works with, OpenSearch or Derivative Works of OpenSearch, such as cloud management services. Users should not be confused as to the source of your software or services. With that in mind, you may use the “OpenSearch” word mark to refer to services for, or software that works with, OpenSearch or Derivative Works of OpenSearch provided (a) you include an additional identifier indicating you as the source of the software or services (e.g., “Foocorp’s OpenSearch Tool” or “Foocorp OpenSearch Service”), (b) if your services or software works with Derivative Works of OpenSearch, you clearly identify the modifications and indicate the source of the modifications, (c) your use does not suggest any affiliation between OpenSearch or the OpenSearch Community and you or your work, and (d) your use of the “OpenSearch” mark should not be more prominent than your additional identifier.

You may also use the “OpenSearch” word mark to make accurate statements about compatibility and interoperability using relational phrases such as “works with,” “runs on,” “compatible with,” and the like (e.g., “Foocorp Software powered by OpenSearch” or “Foocorp Software for OpenSearch” or “Foocorp Software with OpenSearch compatibility”).
