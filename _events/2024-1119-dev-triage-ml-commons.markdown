**Agenda:**

**Triage issues** *(add the triaged label once reviewed/ready. They can be also labelled as sprint backlog if we are looking to queueing them up next, or good first issue / help wanted when appropriate.)*

* [Backend ml-commons](https://github.com/opensearch-project/ml-commons/issues)
* [Dashboards ml-commons](https://github.com/opensearch-project/ml-commons-dashboards/issues)

**Sprint backlog** *(Examine if it still reflects the work that we are committing to doing and is it in the right priority order)*

* [Backend ml-commons](https://github.com/opensearch-project/ml-commons/issues)
* [Dashboards ml-commons](https://github.com/opensearch-project/ml-commons-dashboards/issues)

**Backlog** *(anything we should move to sprint backlog? anything we should tag asking for help from the community?)*

* [Backend ml-commons](https://github.com/opensearch-project/ml-commons/issues)
* [Dashboards ml-commons](https://github.com/opensearch-project/ml-commons-dashboards/issues)
