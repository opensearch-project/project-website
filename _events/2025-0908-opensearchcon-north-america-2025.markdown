OpenSearchCon is the annual conference that brings the OpenSearch community together to learn, connect, and collaborate. Users, administrators, and developers attend to explore solutions to real-world problems, network with peers, and explore the future of search, observability, and security applications.

We're excited to see the OpenSearch Community in San Jose this year, September 8 - 10!
