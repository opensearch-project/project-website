Haystack is the conference for improving search relevance. If you're like us, you work to understand the shiny new tools or dense academic papers out there that promise the moon. Then you puzzle how to apply those insights to your search problem, in your search stack. But the path isn't always easy, and the promised gains don't always materialize.

Haystack is the conference for organizations where search, matching, and relevance really matters to the bottom line. For search managers, developers, relevance engineers & data scientists finding ways to innovate, see past the silver bullets, and share what actually has worked well for their unique problems. Please come share and learn!

Featuring talks from AWS OpenSearch, Getty Images, Elsevier Health, Delivery Hero, Pinecone, Weaviate & a raft of other search experts!
