    title: Join on Meetup

---

The Fluent Community meeting is an online meetup centered around the Fluentd and Fluent Bit open source projects that are part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). We also sometimes branch off into discussions of observability in general.

Users who are interested in discussing the projects, communicating with maintainers, or who are eager to learn about the technologies should join. New users are welcomed.

Our agenda for the meeting is an [open document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vJvsn8E0SanLO1R0X3RC1qTw0XQK_7q75sZ8IbWAu-g/edit).
