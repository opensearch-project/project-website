# Define a category for the event. This is used for filtering behaviors and styling on the events pages.
# This is limited to the following values: "community", "development", "user-group", "events".
# Un-comment the line that defines the category for this event.
category: community
# category: development
# category: user-group
# category: events

# Array of event host identifiers.
# For hosts who have _authors information defined the short_name value will map to the meta data in that collection item.
# For hosts without a corresponding entry in the _authors collection the github, or the linkedin URL can be used to provide
# a link to more information about the host.
# This value must be an array even if there is only one host. This rule simplifies template logic.
hosts:
  - name: Host name
    short_name: Value that maps to the short_name in the _authors collection, if defined.
    github: URL to the host's GitHub profile if short_name is not defined.
    linkedin: URL to the host's LinkedIn profile if short_name is not defined.
