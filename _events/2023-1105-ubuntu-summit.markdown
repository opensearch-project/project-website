[Aparna Sundar](https://opensearch.org/community/members/aparna-sundar.html), Senior Researcher at OpenSearch Project & [Kris Freedain](https://opensearch.org/community/members/kris-freedain.html), Community Manager at OpenSearch Project will be giving at talk at [Ubuntu Summit](https://events.canonical.com/event/31/) 2023: "Importance of Measuring Trust in Organizations and How Community Presence can Help".

**Description:**

While transparency is a key pillar of open-source projects, questions on trust often surface. Critics of open-source code question the level of self-critique that contributors demonstrate that could end up in “bad faith” commits. Critiques also argue and question if the open-source system is designed for security given the nature of the lack of accountability, given the open-source or “free” nature and vulnerability of developers to hackers etc. As the source code is available to anyone to modify or distribute, developers trusting the project is important. Individual developers and companies alike trust open-source software as it is easier to use than developing code from scratch
