**March 4 & 5 - FOSS Backstage**
The OpenSearch Project is a main partner at this year’s [FOSS Backstage](https://24.foss-backstage.de/); The two day conference dedicated to everything related to FOSS governance and open collaboration. Be sure to stop by our booth. We’re looking forward to seeing the open-source community this year in Berlin!

**March 6 - FOSS Backstage Design**
As part of the week FOSS Backstage Design will take a deep dive into UX Design in FOSS. On March 6th, Aparna Sundar will be giving a talk **[Increasing the human element in open source software](https://24.foss-backstage.de/sessions-ux24/?id=SD9WAM)** where she will share her experience about building open source software while maintaining a good balance of community input. Come discuss the ways in which software engineers or developers, designers, community and product managers can adopt and incorporate research practices in software design.
