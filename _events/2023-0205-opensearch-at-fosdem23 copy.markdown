Come visit with us at FOSDEM, Brussels! David will be presenting, "Python Logging Like Your Job Depends on It". It is a fast track to understanding logging in Python that ends in a demo of how to log into OpenSearch with Python.

If you'd like to meetup at FOSDEM or chat about the event we can all use [this forum thread](https://forum.opensearch.org/t/fosdem-2023-thread/12102)! Hope to see everyone there.
