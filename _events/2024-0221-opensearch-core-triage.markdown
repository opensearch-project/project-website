Join the OpenSearch community to review and triage incoming issues in the OpenSearch repository. Meetings are open-to-all and attendance is encouraged for anyone who hopes to contribute, discuss an issue, or learn more about the project. See Triaging on OpenSearch for more details and FAQs.

### Agenda

1. **Initial Gathering:** Feel free to turn on your video and engage in informal conversation. Shortly, a volunteer triage [facilitator](#what-is-the-role-of-the-facilitator) will begin the meeting and share their screen.
2. **Record Attendees:** The facilitator will request attendees to share their GitHub profile links. These links will be collected and assembled into a [tag](#how-do-triage-facilitator-tag-comments-during-the-triage-meeting) to annotate comments during the meeting.
3. **Announcements:** Any announcements will be made at the beginning of the meeting.
4. **Review of New Issues:** We start by reviewing all untriaged [issues](https://github.com/search?q=label%3Auntriaged+is%3Aopen++repo%3Aopensearch-project%2FOpenSearch+&type=issues&ref=advsearch&s=created&o=desc) for the OpenSearch repo.
5. **Attendee Requests:** An opportunity for any meeting member to request consideration of an issue or pull request.
6. **Open Discussion:** Attendees can bring up any topics not already covered by filed issues or pull requests.
