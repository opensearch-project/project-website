Observability Day fosters collaboration, discussion, and knowledge sharing of cloud-native observability projects (including but not necessarily limited to Prometheus, Fluentd, Fluent Bit, OpenTelemetry, and OpenMetrics), as well as vendor-neutral best practices for addressing observability challenges. Sessions include a keynote, panel discussions, workshops, lightning talks, and individual presentations. This event is intended both for audiences that are new to observability as well as for seasoned practitioners. Observability Day will enable you to spend a day peeking under the hood of major Cloud Native Computing Foundation observability-related projects and broadening your knowledge of observability.
