Join the OpenSearch Security team for their next backlog & triage planning meeting.

(hosts: [Dave Lago](https://github.com/davidlago), [Peter Nied](https://github.com/peternied), & [Stephen Crawford](https://github.com/scrawfor99))

**Agenda:**

**Triage issues** *(add the triaged label once reviewed/ready. They can be also labelled as sprint backlog if we are looking to queueing them up next, or good first issue / help wanted when appropriate.)*

* [Backend security](https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+-label%3Atriaged+)
* [Dashboards security](https://github.com/opensearch-project/security-dashboards-plugin/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+-label%3Atriaged+)

**Sprint backlog** *(Examine if it still reflects the work that we are committing to doing and is it in the right priority order)*

* [Backend security](https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22sprint+backlog%22+)
* [Dashboards security](https://github.com/opensearch-project/security-dashboards-plugin/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22sprint+backlog%22+)

**Backlog** *(anything we should move to sprint backlog? anything we should tag asking for help from the community?)*

* [Backend security](https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+-label%3A%22sprint+backlog%22+-label%3A%22WIP%22+label%3A%22triaged%22+)
* [Dashboards security](https://github.com/opensearch-project/security-dashboards-plugin/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+-label%3A%22sprint+backlog%22+-label%3A%22WIP%22+label%3A%22triaged%22)
