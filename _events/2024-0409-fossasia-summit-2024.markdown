"**User Perception as it Informs AI Perception of Performance**"

Testing is an important aspect of improving AI models. An untapped and less understood area of product development is to test results in a way that provides greater opportunities to frame AI responses. In this talk, I offer an example of user testing, take aways and how we improved the user experience of an AI Assistant. I cover discoveries at the early stages of development, the way in which users use design heuristics in evaluating AI. Users make judgments on information presented by AI in a way that can overwhelm, undermine or boost trust or confidence in the AI model. I conclude by providing design decisions that can help the user disambiguate the information offered by the AI model.
