OpenSearchCon is the annual conference that brings the OpenSearch community together to learn, connect, and collaborate. Users, administrators, and developers attend to explore solutions to real-world problems, network with peers, and explore the future of search, observability, and security applications.

We're excited to see the OpenSearch Community in Amsterdam this year, 30 April - 1 May!
