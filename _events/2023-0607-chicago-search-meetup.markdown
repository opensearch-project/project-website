Please join the [Bonsai](http://bonsai.io/) team, hosted by [Spantree](https://spantree.net/) and in partnership with the OpenSearch Project. This will be an in-person event, launching the [Chicago search engineer community](https://www.meetup.com/opensearch-project-chicago/).

This event will be a great opportunity to network within the search technology community, and learn more about what the OpenSearch team is building.

[David Tippett](https://twitter.com/dtaivpp) will present an in-depth look at BM-25, which is a search relevancy algorithm. He will also share the feature roadmap for OpenSearch.
