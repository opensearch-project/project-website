Join the OpenSearch Dashboards team for developer office hours.

(host: [Josh Romero](https://github.com/joshuarrrr))

**Agenda:**

*Visit the [forum post](https://forum.opensearch.org/t/opensearch-dashboards-developer-office-hours-2023-07-27/14911) to sign-up and view planned topics.*

The meeting is divided into four 15-minute slots for community developers to chat with [OpenSearch Dashboards project maintainers](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md). Priority will be given to topics that are signed-up in advance, but ad-hoc discussions are welcome in any remaining time. If there are no sign-ups, maintainers will present a brief knowledge-sharing session or demo and the meeting may end early.

***Please see Meetup link for URL and required passcode.***

After the meeting, we will post the chat log and any meeting notes. We welcome you to keep the conversation going on the forum.
