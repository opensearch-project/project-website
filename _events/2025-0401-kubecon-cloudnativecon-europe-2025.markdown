Join us in booth #N241 at [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon (“KubeCon”)](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/) in London to learn more about OpenSearch observability—community driven—done your way! Discover how OpenSearch makes it possible to deliver integrated, cost-effective solutions that address observability, security analytics, and SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) use cases. And you’re able to achieve this while optimizing costs, simplifying data management, and reducing tool sprawl. 

A semi-annual conference hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), KubeCon targets technologists from leading open source and cloud native communities for education and advancement of cloud native computing with an emphasis on the Kubernetes community.
