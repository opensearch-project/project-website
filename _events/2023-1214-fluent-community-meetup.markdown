The Fluent Community meeting is an online meetup centered around the Fluentd and Fluent Bit open source projects that are part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

Users who are interested in discussing the projects, communicating with maintainers, or are eager to learn about the technologies should join. We also discuss general observability topics for those who are looking to learn more about the subject.

Our agenda for the meeting is an [open document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vJvsn8E0SanLO1R0X3RC1qTw0XQK_7q75sZ8IbWAu-g/edit). If you want to add topics to the agenda please request edit permissions.
