[Zeta Alpha](https://www.zeta-alpha.com/) is inviting the OpenSearch community in Amsterdam to join the launch event of the Amsterdam User Group. We start at 18:00, we'll have Pizza, Refreshments, Talks, and Networking (this is an in-person only event).

**What our group is about:**

We are a group of people in the Amsterdam area with keen interest in search engineering, open-source search technology, and search relevancy. If you've utilized or are simply curious about core search technologies like OpenSearch, Lucene, or Solr, and their application in fields such as enterprise search, vector search, and generative AI, this is the space for you!

We embrace all skill levels. Even if search is just a small part of your day-to-day duties, come learn and connect with other smart engineers. We cover and welcome talks on topics including: search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for Large Language Models (LLM), data connectors and data visualization.

**Time and location:**

November 10th, 2023 from 18:00 to 19:30. Room L3.36 at Lab 42, Science Park 900, Amsterdam.

**Schedule:**

* 18:00 -- Arrival with food, drinks.
* 18:30 -- OpenSearch and Generative AI - Nate Boot.
* 18:50 -- OpenSearch vector capabilities - Jettro Coenradie.
* 19:10 -- Retrieval Augmented Generation: Lucene based vs Vector databases - Fernando Rejon Barrera.
* 19:30 -- Networking with drinks.
* 20:00 -- Closing.

**Talks:**

**OpenSearch and Generative AI**

Experiences with OpenSearch and generative AI as a developer advocate for the OpenSearch Project.

*Speaker: [Nate Boot](https://github.com/nateynateynate), Developer Advocate - OpenSearch Project.*

**OpenSearch vector capabilities**

Lexical search is powering the majority of search engines today. It works for eCommerce, the legal domain, the medical domain, etc. However, you must know what you are looking for to find something. Without the right terms, you must be lucky if someone added a synonym for your term. What if you can search for concepts rather than terms?

During this presentation, you step into the semantic or vector search world. You get introduced to the vector search capabilities of OpenSearch. Together, we explore the different options OpenSearch has for Vector Search. Through a demo, you see the difference between lexical and vector search.

*Speaker: Jettro Coenradie, Information Retrieval Specialist | Coach | Architect at Luminis.*

**Retrieval Augmented Generation: Lucene based vs Vector databases**

Selecting the right retrieval backend for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can be the decisive factor between success and failure. In this talk, I'll share insights gained from building RAG systems for enterprise applications, highlighting the critical factors for ensuring quality, performance, and security. Join me for practical advice on moving your RAG system beyond the POC phase.

*Speaker: Fernando Rejon Barrera, CTO at Zeta Alpha.*
