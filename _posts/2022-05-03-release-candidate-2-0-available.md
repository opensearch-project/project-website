I am excited to share that the release candidate (RC1) for version 2.0.0 of OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards is now available for testing and validation. As a release candidate, this version of the project is feature complete and has passed automated testing, but we'll continue to add bug fixes until the full "General Availability" (GA) release date.

The request to you, as members of the OpenSearch project community, is to deploy the release candidate in a test environment and open [issues](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues) to report any problems you discover. Your support for testing and feedback helps ensure that the candidate can become the best possible product it can be -- so please, go kick the tires and tell us what you think.
 
OpenSearch 2.0.0 RC1 includes a number of new features and enhancements, such as Lucene 9, Document Level Alerting, and more. Before installing or upgrading to OpenSearch 2.0.0 RC1 or OpenSearch Dashboards 2.0.0 RC1, please read the [release notes](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/blob/main/release-notes/opensearch-release-notes-2.0.0-rc1.md). We'd also love your feedback on the [OpenSearch documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/2.0/). If you see content that's missing or could be improved, please submit a [PR](https://github.com/opensearch-project/documentation-website/pulls) or open an [issue](https://github.com/opensearch-project/documentation-website/issues). 
 
You can download the release candidate [here](https://opensearch.org/versions/opensearch-2-0-0-rc1.html). As a reminder, this release candidate is provided for testing and validation purposes only. Please don't use this release candidate in a production environment.

Finally, because the release date for 2.0.0 RC1 was delayed, the GA version of 2.0 is now scheduled for May 24 to allow more time for community feedback. You can keep up to date with the latest on the 2.0 release [here](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/issues/1650).

Thank you, and happy testing!
