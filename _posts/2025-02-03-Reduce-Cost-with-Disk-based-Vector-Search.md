Vector search has gained significant attention in the area of information retrieval thanks to advances in natural language embedding models. These models map domain-specific data into a vector space, where similar pieces of data are positioned close to each other. When you run a search, the query is embedded into this space, and a nearest neighbor search identifies the most similar results based on distance calculations.

Vectors are arrays of fixed dimensions that store numeric values (float, byte, or bit). The shape of the vector and the function used to compare vectors are determined by the embedding model. For example, when you pass a chunk of text to the [Cohere v3 multilingual embedding model](https://cohere.com/blog/introducing-embed-v3), the model returns a 1,024-dimensional vector of 32-bit floating-point numbers representing the text in the vector space, as shown in the following image.

To determine similarity, the "distance" between vectors is computed using functions like the dot product or the Euclidean metric. The choice of distance function is typically dictated by the model that generates the embeddings. Vector search excels at capturing the implicit meaning of data, often leading to more accurate results. Additionally, combining vector search with traditional text-based search can further improve search quality.

## The memory footprint of vector search

Vector-based indexes can be very large. For example, storing 1 billion 768-dimensional floating-point embeddings requires approximately `1000^3 * 768 * 4 ~= 2861 GB` of storage. This cost increases further when replicas are enabled and additional metadata is added. Traditionally, many efficient nearest neighbor algorithms require vectors to be fully resident in memory to enable fast search because search involves random access patterns. This makes it difficult to efficiently retrieve vectors from disk and leads to high costs as the number of vectors increases, as shown in the following figure.

![Number of vectors compared to memory requirement](/assets/media/blog-images/2025-02-03-Reduce-Cost-with-Disk-based-Vector-Search/vector-v-mem-footprint.png){:class="img-centered"}

To reduce the memory footprint of vector indexes, vector quantization techniques are typically employed. Quantization compresses vectors into smaller representations while trying to minimize information loss. For example, [FP16 quantization](https://opensearch.org/blog/optimizing-opensearch-with-fp16-quantization/) converts 32-bit floats to 16-bit floats, reducing memory usage by half. Because many datasets do not require the full 32-bit space, we do not commonly see a reduction in accuracy with this approach.

In addition to FP16, quantization can be used to compress vectors even further, with compression factors of `4x`, `8x`, `16x`, `32x`, and beyond. Reducing memory usage further translates to significant cost savings.

However, quantization comes with a trade-off: The more compression that is applied, the greater the potential reduction in search accuracy. Fortunately, with improvements in secondary storage, it's possible to trade some search latency for accurate nearest neighbor search in a low-memory environment.

## Disk-based vector search in OpenSearch

In 2.17, we introduced an `on_disk` mode for `knn_vector` fields that enables disk-based vector search in OpenSearch, allowing searches to run in lower-memory environments. This is achieved using a two-phase query approach, illustrated in the following diagram.  

![High-level two-phase query approach](/assets/media/blog-images/2025-02-03-Reduce-Cost-with-Disk-based-Vector-Search/hla.png){:class="img-centered"}

First, during ingestion, we build indexes using configurable quantization mechanisms and store the full-precision vectors on disk. The quantized indexes, which reside fully in memory during search, require significantly less memory due to compression.  

During search, we first query the quantized indexes to retrieve more than k candidate results. Then we lazily load the full-precision vectors of these candidates into memory and recompute the distance to the query. This reordering step ensures accuracy, and we return only the top k results.  

Empirically, this two-phase approach has demonstrated the ability to produce [high-recall results](https://github.com/opensearch-project/k-NN/issues/1779#user-content-appendix-b-baseline-rescore-experiments) across a variety of quantization techniques.

### Introducing online binary quantization  

As part of this feature, we also expanded our quantization support. Previously, achieving ≥8x compression in OpenSearch required using product quantization. While effective, product quantization requires a training step before ingestion can begin and requires users to manage their models.  

**In 2.17, we introduced several new online quantization techniques for 8x, 16x, and 32x compression—no pretraining needed. You can begin ingestion immediately without additional model preparation.** This simplifies the process and reduces overhead. Take a look at this technical deep dive to learn how we developed these capabilities.

Consider the following 8-dimensional vectors of 32-bit floating-point numbers: 

```python
v1 = [0.56, 0.85, 0.53, 0.25, 0.46, 0.01, 0.63, 0.73]
v2 = [-0.99, -0.79, 0.23, -0.62, 0.87, -0.06, -0.24, -0.75]
v3 = [-0.15, 0.17, 0.10, 0.46, -0.79, -0.31, 0.36, -1.00]
```

In order to quantize them, we perform the following steps.

#### 1. Calculate mean per dimension

The mean for each dimension j is calculated using the following formula:

![Mean Formula](/assets/media/blog-images/2025-02-03-Reduce-Cost-with-Disk-based-Vector-Search/mean.png){:class="img-centered" width="500px"}

The preceding set of vectors produces the following calculated mean:

```python
Mean = [-0.19, 0.08, 0.29, 0.03, 0.18, -0.12, 0.25, -0.34]
```

#### 2. Quantization of a new vector

The quantization rule for each dimension j of a vector is given by the following logic:

![Quantization Formula](/assets/media/blog-images/2025-02-03-Reduce-Cost-with-Disk-based-Vector-Search/quantization.png){:class="img-centered"  width="500px"}

Consider a new vector:

```python
v_new = [0.45, -0.30, 0.67, 0.12, 0.25, -0.50, 0.80, 0.55]
```

To quantize this vector, we compare each dimension to the mean value. When a dimension exceeds the mean, we convert it to `1`; otherwise, we convert it to `0`, as shown in the following diagram. 

![Quantization Example](/assets/media/blog-images/2025-02-03-Reduce-Cost-with-Disk-based-Vector-Search/quantization-example.png){:class="img-centered"}

## Try disk-based vector search

To set up disk-based vector search, simply set the `mode` to `on_disk` in the index mappings. This parameter automatically configures a low-memory setting with rescoring enabled:

```json
PUT my-vector-index
{
  "settings" : {
    "index.knn": true
  },
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "my_vector_field": {
        "type": "knn_vector",
        "dimension": 8,
        "space_type": "innerproduct",
        "mode": "on_disk"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To tune the quantization, you can specify the `compression_level` in the mapping. By default for `on_disk` mode, it is `32x`:

```json
PUT my-vector-index
{
  "settings" : {
    "index.knn": true
  },
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "my_vector_field": {
        "type": "knn_vector",
        "dimension": 8,
        "space_type": "innerproduct",
        "mode": "on_disk",
        "compression_level": "16x"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

At search time, if `mode` is set to `on_disk`, OpenSearch automatically applies a two-phase search process:

```json
GET my-vector-index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "knn": {
      "my_vector_field": {
        "vector": [1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5],
        "k": 5
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When you use `on_disk` mode, OpenSearch configures an oversample factor to return more than k results from the quantized index search. You can override this default setting by specifying an `oversample_factor` in the query body:

```json
GET my-vector-index/_search
{
  "query": {
    "knn": {
      "my_vector_field": {
        "vector": [1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5],
        "k": 5,
        "rescore": {
            "oversample_factor": 10.0
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Experiments

To evaluate the performance of disk-based vector search, we conducted several experiments using various dataset sizes and configurations.

### One million vector tests

We ran several different tests on a [single-node OpenSearch cluster](https://github.com/jmazanec15/opensearch-knn-single-node-experiments) for datasets containing between 1 and 10 million vectors.

We conducted experiments comparing `in_memory` and `on_disk` modes using `1x`, `2x`, `4x`, `8x`, `16x`, and `32x` compression levels. Key testing parameters included the following:

- `on_disk` mode: Includes a rescoring stage
- `in_memory` mode: Does not include a rescoring stage
- Hardware configuration:
  - `in_memory` tests: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) r6g.4xlarge instances
  - `on_disk` tests: Amazon EC2 r6gd.4xlarge instances with an attached solid-state drive (SSD)---as opposed to Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) storage
- Resource controls: Used Docker to manage OpenSearch's memory and CPU allocation

We obtained the following results, comparing recall to compression level.

![Million Vector Results](/assets/media/blog-images/2025-02-03-Reduce-Cost-with-Disk-based-Vector-Search/mill-results.png){:class="img-centered"}

The results show that combining quantization with full-precision rescoring can significantly improve recall while maintaining reasonable latency in low-memory environments. However, performance varies by dataset. For example, while this approach improves the performance of the `sift` dataset, the recall remains relatively low. We recommend testing using your specific dataset to determine the optimal configuration.

### Large-scale tests

In addition to the smaller-scale tests, we also ran a test on a larger dataset, [MS MARCO 2.1 encoded with the Cohere v3 model](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Cohere/msmarco-v2.1-embed-english-v3). We set up several different tests to showcase how this disk-based vector search compares to `in_memory` vector search at `8x`, `16x`, and `32x` compression levels. We ran these tests using the following configuration.

| Dataset      | [MS MARCO 2.1 encoded with the Cohere v3 model](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Cohere/msmarco-v2.1-embed-english-v3)                                       |
| Dimension  | 1,024                                                                     |
| Normalized      | Yes                                                                      |
| Space type | Cosine (inner product over normalized data)                              |
| Index vectors | 113M                                                                     |

We tested four different cluster configurations using the [opensearch-cluster-cdk](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-cluster-cdk) with OpenSearch 2.18. We selected the cluster and index configuration to follow production recommendations. For example, we configured replica shards and dedicated cluster manager nodes. In addition, we targeted a shard count that provides 2 to 3 vCPUs per shard. The following table presents the configurations for these tests.

| Name        | Data node count | Data node type | Data node disk size | Data node disk type | JVM size | Primary shard count | Replica shards | Compression level |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|---------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| `in_memory`   | 8               | r6g.8xlarge    | 300                 | EBS                 | 32       | 40                  | 1              | 1x                |
| `on_disk_8x`  | 10              | r6gd.2xlarge   | 474                 | Instance            | 32       | 15                  | 1              | 8x                |
| `on_disk_16x` | 6               | r6gd.2xlarge   | 474                 | Instance            | 32 | 9    | 1                   | 16x            |
| `on_disk_32x` | 4               | r6gd.2xlarge   | 474                 | Instance            | 32 | 6    | 1                   | 32x            |

In the table, note that clusters with higher compression levels use significantly fewer resources than those without compression.

To optimize performance in our tests, we made these additional adjustments:

- Retrieved IDs from `doc_values` to reduce fetch time
- Disabled `_source` storage 

We ran all tests using OpenSearch Benchmark [vector search workloads](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-benchmark-workloads/tree/main/vectorsearch), following this procedure:

1. Ingest the dataset.
2. Force merge the index to 5 segments per shard.
3. Run warm-up queries to load the index into memory.
4. Run the single-client latency test.
5. Run the multi-client throughput test.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 with disk-based rescoring disabled to measure performance on a compressed index without rescoring.

We obtained the following large-scale test results.

| Metric/configuration              | `in-memory` | `on_disk_8x` | `in_memory_8x` | `on_disk_16x` | `in_memory_16x` | `on_disk_32x` | `in_memory_32x` |
|-----------------------------------|-----------|------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| recall@100 (ratio)                | 0.95      | 0.98       | 0.98         | 0.97        | 0.96          | 0.94        | 0.95          |
| 1-client p90 search latency (ms)  | 24.02     | 96.31      | 28.90        | 108.05      | 29.79         | 104.421     | 47.2906       |
| 1-client mean throughput (QPS)           | 40.64     | 11.03      | 42.33        | 10.06       | 43.95         | 10.65       | 31.83         |
| 4-client p90 search latency (ms)  | 25.82     | 97.19      | 20.40        | 220.19      | 18.09         | 244.52      | 46.13         |
| 4-client mean throughput (QPS)           | 162.80    | 45.86      | 204.62       | 25.80       | 193.27        | 25.28       | 146.77        |
| 8-client p90 search latency (ms) | 27.69     | 95.05      | 30.88        | 414.20      | 27.94         | 429.79      | 25.07         |
| 8-client mean throughput (QPS)           | 306.70    | 95.22      | 305.86       | 26.34       | 343.95        | 25.75       | 376.60        |

Interestingly, for this dataset, the on-disk approach with rescoring produces similar recall to the in-memory approach without rescoring, but the in-memory approach is substantially faster. This is most likely because the Cohere v3 model has been optimized to work very well with binary quantized data (see [this blog post](https://cohere.com/blog/int8-binary-embeddings)).

## Learnings

Our testing shows that the two-phase approximate nearest neighbor approach performs effectively in low-memory environments, though results vary significantly by dataset. When running your own experiments, we recommend testing with the `index.knn.disk.vector.shard_level_rescoring_disabled` setting both enabled and disabled to measure the performance benefit for your use case. Additionally, with disk-based search, ensure that your secondary storage is optimized for high read traffic---we found that SSDs generally provide the best results.

## What's next?

We have many new and exciting features coming for vector search in OpenSearch. In future versions, we'll focus on improving quantization performance for all datasets, eliminating the need for fine-tuning. Follow our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/opensearch-project/k-NN) for continued improvements in both performance and functionality. As always, we welcome and appreciate your contributions and feature requests!
