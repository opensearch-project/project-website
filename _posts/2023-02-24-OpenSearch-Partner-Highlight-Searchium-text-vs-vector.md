On their own, text databases and vector search tools can add a lot of value to commercial workloads. [A recent blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/text-search-vs-vector-search-better-together-3bd48eb6132a) by Noam Schwartz of OpenSearch Project Partner, [Searchium.ai](https://www.searchium.ai/), explains how these tools can deliver significant impact using a hybrid approach. In the blog, [“Text search vs. Vector search: Better together?](https://towardsdatascience.com/text-search-vs-vector-search-better-together-3bd48eb6132a),” Schwartz explores how combining text and vector search using OpenSearch and Sentence Transformers can help organizations improve their search results. Schwartz also presents an approach to reduced latency and improved operating costs by applying OpenSearch’s Associative Processing Unit (APU).
