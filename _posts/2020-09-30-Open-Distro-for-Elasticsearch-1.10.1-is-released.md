We are pleased to announce the release of [Open Distro for Elasticsearch 1.10.1](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/downloads.html). With this release we are adding support for several new features including a new [command line interface](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/anomaly-detection/tree/master/cli) and [sample data](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/anomaly-detection-kibana-plugin/pull/272) for Anomaly Detection, an [email destination](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/alerting/pull/244) in Alerting, a [warmup API](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/k-NN#warmup-api) in k-NN, and an overhauled Kibana plugin for Security. Open Distro for Elasticsearch 1.10.1 and Open Distro for Elasticsearch Kibana 1.10.1 can be downloaded [here](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/downloads.html).

Open Distro for Elasticsearch 1.10.1 includes version 7.9.1 of Open Source Elasticsearch and Kibana, plus Apache-2.0-licensed extensions that provide alerting, anomaly detection, index management, performance analysis, security, SQL, and k-NN features. Other components, including ODBC and JDBC drivers, a command-line SQL client, and a command-line performance visualization tool (“PerfTop”) are also available to download.

## Download the latest packages

You can find Docker Hub images [Open Distro for Elasticsearch 1.10.1](https://hub.docker.com/r/amazon/opendistro-for-elasticsearch) and [Open Distro for Elasticsearch Kibana 1.10.1](https://hub.docker.com/r/amazon/opendistro-for-elasticsearch-kibana) on Docker Hub. Make sure your compose file specifies 1.10.1 or uses the ‘latest’ tag.

If you’re using RPMs or DEBs, see our documentation on how to install Open Distro for Elasticsearch with [RPMs](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/install/rpm/) and install Open Distro for Elasticsearch with [Debian packages](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/install/deb/). A [tarball](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/install/tar/) is also available for testing and other applications.

A [Windows package](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/install/windows/) supporting version 1.10.1 enables users to install Elasticsearch and Kibana on Windows. If you’re using Kubernetes, check out the [Helm chart](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/install/helm/) to install Open Distro for Elasticsearch.

You can find Open Distro for Elasticsearch security, alerting notification and job scheduler artifacts on [Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.amazon.opendistroforelasticsearch).

You can download the latest versions of Open Distro for Elasticsearch’s [PerfTop client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws/opendistro-for-elasticsearch-perftop) on npm.org, Open Distro for Elasticsearch’s latest [SQL CLI client](https://pypi.org/project/odfe-sql-cli/) on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/odfe-sql-cli/). SQL drivers supporting [ODBC](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/sql/odbc/) and [JDBC](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/sql/jdbc/) are also available.

## Release Highlights

*	Anomaly Detection supports a [command line interface](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/anomaly-detection/tree/master/cli) that allows users to create, start, stop and delete detectors, and work with multiple clusters using named profiles.
*	Anomaly Detection supports three different types of [sample detectors and corresponding indices](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/anomaly-detection-kibana-plugin/pull/272) that allow users to detect sample anomalies using logs related to HTTP response codes, eCommerce orders, and CPU and memory of a host.
*	The Alerting feature now supports [email destinations](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/alerting/pull/244) to send notifications without using a web hook.
*	K-NN supports [warmup API](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/k-NN#warmup-api) that allows users to explicitly load indices’ graphs used for approximate k-NN search into memory before performing their search workload. With this API, users no longer need to run random queries to prevent initial latency penalties for loading graphs into the cache.
*	The updated Kibana plugin for Security streamlines security workflows, improves usability and adds audit and compliance logging configuration.
