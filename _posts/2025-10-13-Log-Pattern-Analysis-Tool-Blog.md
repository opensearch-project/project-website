---

Modern distributed systems generate massive amounts of log data, making manual troubleshooting increasingly challenging. OpenSearch 3.3 introduces the **Log Pattern Analysis Tool**â€”a powerful algorithmic solution that transforms how we approach root cause analysis (RCA) by automatically identifying anomalous log patterns and sequences.

## Introduction

In today's complex microservices environments, system failures often manifest as subtle changes in log patterns that are difficult to detect manually. Traditional log analysis approaches require significant time and expertise to correlate events across multiple services and identify root causes.

The Log Pattern Analysis Tool addresses these challenges by leveraging advanced pattern recognition and clustering algorithms to automatically:

* Compare log patterns between baseline and problem periods
* Identify anomalous execution sequences using trace correlation
* Extract meaningful insights from large volumes of log data
* Provide actionable intelligence for faster incident resolution

This tool can be used standalone for direct log analysis or integrated with OpenSearch's agent framework, enabling fully automated troubleshooting workflows that can significantly reduce mean time to resolution.

## What is the Log Pattern Analysis Tool?

The Log Pattern Analysis Tool is an advanced log analysis capability within OpenSearch 3.3's agent framework, designed to automate the complex process of identifying system anomalies through algorithmic pattern recognition. This tool can be used as a component for AI agents performing root cause analysis in distributed systems.

### Core capabilities

The tool automatically selects from three analysis approaches based on the parameters provided:

**Log Pattern Differential Analysis**
* Compares log patterns between baseline and problem time periods
* Calculates statistical significance of pattern changes using lift metrics
* Identifies newly emerged patterns and those with significant frequency changes

**Log Sequence Analysis**
* Groups log patterns by trace ID and clusters similar execution sequences
* Identifies anomalous traces that differ significantly from baseline behavior

**Log Insights Analysis**
* Automatically extracts error keywords and patterns from logs containing error-related terms
* Provides representative sample logs for identified patterns
* Enables rapid identification of system issues through keyword matching
* Returns top 5 most frequent error patterns for immediate troubleshooting

## Technical architecture and algorithms

The Log Pattern Analysis Tool uses statistical methods and clustering algorithms to identify patterns in log data and detect anomalies. Understanding how these algorithms work helps configure the tool effectively for your specific use case.

### Algorithm foundation

The tool employs a multi-layered approach to log analysis:

**Pattern Recognition Engine**
* Uses OpenSearch's PPL patterns command with brain algorithm (`method=brain`) to extract log patterns
* Identifies recurring structures while handling dynamic content with configurable variable count threshold

**Vectorization and Similarity**
* Employs IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) weighting to calculate pattern significance
* Uses sigmoid functions for pattern vectorization and normalization: `1.0 / (1.0 + Math.exp(-idf))`
* Calculates pattern similarity using cosine similarity metrics and Jaccard similarity for pattern merging

**Clustering and Anomaly Detection**
* Uses clustering helper to group similar trace vectors based on cosine similarity
* Compares selection traces against baseline representatives to identify anomalies

## Real-world use cases

The Log Pattern Analysis Tool excels in various operational scenarios where traditional log analysis falls short. Here are key use cases where it provides significant value:

### Microservices failure diagnosis

In complex distributed systems, failures often cascade across multiple services, making root cause identification challenging. The tool addresses this by:

* Identifying abnormal service call sequences through trace correlation
* Discovering newly emerged error patterns that indicate system degradation



### Performance degradation analysis

Performance issues often manifest gradually through subtle changes in log patterns. The tool helps by:

* Identifying log patterns associated with performance degradation
* Analyzing changes in slow query patterns and timeout behaviors
* Discovering resource bottleneck indicators in log data
* Correlating performance metrics with specific execution paths

### Security incident investigation

Security threats often leave traces in log data that are difficult to detect manually. The tool enhances security analysis by:

* Identifying abnormal access patterns and authentication anomalies
* Discovering security-related error logs and suspicious activities
* Analyzing behavioral patterns that may indicate attack vectors
* Providing rapid threat detection capabilities for incident response teams

## Getting started with the Log Pattern Analysis Tool

### Parameter reference

Understanding the tool's parameters is essential for effective analysis configuration:

**Required parameters**
* `index`: Target OpenSearch index containing log data
* `timeField`: Timestamp field name (typically `@timestamp`)
* `logFieldName`: Field containing the actual log message content
* `selectionTimeRangeStart`: Start time for the analysis period
* `selectionTimeRangeEnd`: End time for the analysis period

**Optional parameters**
* `traceFieldName`: Field containing trace or correlation IDs (required for sequence analysis)
* `baseTimeRangeStart`: Start time for baseline comparison period (required for sequence and differential analysis)
* `baseTimeRangeEnd`: End time for baseline comparison period (required for sequence and differential analysis)

### Analysis modes

The tool automatically determines the analysis mode based on provided parameters:

1. **Log Sequence Analysis**: When both `traceFieldName` and baseline time range are provided
2. **Log Pattern Differential Analysis**: When only baseline time range is provided (without `traceFieldName`)
3. **Log Insights Analysis**: When only selection time range is provided (no baseline or trace field)

### Error keyword detection

For log insights analysis, the tool automatically searches for logs containing these error-related keywords:

```
error, err, exception, failed, failure, timeout, panic, fatal, critical, severe, abort, aborted, aborting, crash, crashed, broken, corrupt, corrupted, invalid, malformed, unprocessable, denied, forbidden, unauthorized, conflict, deadlock, overflow, underflow, throttled, disk_full, insufficient, retrying, backpressure, degraded, unexpected, unusual, missing, stale, expired, mismatch, violation
```

### PPL query configuration

The tool uses OpenSearch's PPL with specific configurations:

- **Pattern extraction**: Uses `patterns` command with `method=brain` and `variable_count_threshold=3`
- **Sequence analysis**: Includes trace field sorting and filtering for non-empty trace IDs
- **Differential analysis**: Uses `mode=aggregation` for pattern counting
- **Insights analysis**: Uses `mode=aggregation max_sample_count=2` and returns top 5 patternsne comparison period

The baseline period should represent normal system operation, while the selection period covers the time when issues occurred.

## Understanding the results

The Log Pattern Analysis Tool provides structured output that enables quick identification of system anomalies and root causes.

### Log sequence analysis results
```json
{
  "BASE": {
    "trace_id_1": "Login -> Authenticate -> LoadProfile",
    "trace_id_2": "Search -> Filter -> Display"
  },
  "EXCEPTIONAL": {
    "trace_id_3": "Login -> Authenticate -> Error -> Retry -> Timeout",
    "trace_id_4": "Search -> DatabaseError -> Fallback"
  }
}
```

### Log pattern differential analysis results
```json
{
  "patternMapDifference": [
    {
      "pattern": "Database connection <*> failed",
      "base": 0.02,
      "selection": 0.15,
      "lift": 7.5
    },
    {
      "pattern": "Memory usage exceeded <*> threshold",
      "base": 0.01,
      "selection": 0.05,
      "lift": 5.0
    }
  ]
}
```

### Log insights results
```json
{
  "logInsights": [
    {
      "pattern": "Connection refused to <*>",
      "count": 45,
      "sampleLogs": [
        "Connection refused to redis://cache-server:6379",
        "Connection refused to mysql://db-server:3306"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Pattern Caching
- Uses `rawPatternCache` to avoid repeated pattern post-processing
- Pre-compiled regular expressions improve matching efficiency

### 2. Vectorization Optimization
- Employs sparse vector representation to reduce memory usage
- Uses IDF weights to highlight important patterns

### 3. Clustering Optimization
- Hierarchical clustering algorithm suitable for small-scale datasets
- Cosine similarity calculation is highly efficient

## Best Practices

### 1. Time Window Selection
- Baseline time period should be selected during normal system operation
- Analysis time period should cover the complete cycle of problem occurrence
- Baseline and analysis time periods should have similar lengths for accurate comparison

### 2. Field Configuration
- `logFieldName` should select fields containing structured information
- `traceFieldName` is crucial for distributed system analysis
- Use ISO 8601 time format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ` (e.g., `2025-10-24T08:00:00Z`)

### 3. Result Interpretation
- Focus on pattern changes with high lift values
- Prioritize analysis of EXCEPTIONAL sequences

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **PPL Execution Failure**: Check index names and field mappings
2. **No Results Returned**: Verify time ranges and data availability
3. **Performance Issues**: Adjust time window size and data volume
4. **Data Volume Limitation**: PPL queries return maximum 10,000 records, so the tool can analyze at most 10,000 log entries per execution

## Integration with Plan-Execute-Reflect Agent

### Agent Integration Example

Here's a concrete example of how an agent would use the Log Pattern Analysis Tool:

#### User Query
```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/agents/your_agent_id/_execute
{
  "parameters": {
    "question": "Analyze application logs from 10:00 to 11:00 today and compare with the previous hour to identify any anomalies."
  }
}
```

#### Agent's Internal Tool Call

The agent would automatically call the Log Pattern Analysis Tool:

```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/agents/your_agent_id/_execute
{
  "parameters": {
    "index": "application-logs-2025.10.24",
    "timeField": "@timestamp",
    "logFieldName": "message",
    "baseTimeRangeStart": "2025-10-24 09:00:00",
    "baseTimeRangeEnd": "2025-10-24 10:00:00",
    "selectionTimeRangeStart": "2025-10-24 10:00:00",
    "selectionTimeRangeEnd": "2025-10-24 11:00:00"
  }
}
```

#### Tool Response

```json
{
  "patternMapDifference": [
    {
      "pattern": "Database connection <*> failed",
      "base": 0.02,
      "selection": 0.15,
      "lift": 7.5
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Agent's Analysis

Based on the tool's output, the agent would respond:

"I found a significant anomaly in your application logs. The pattern 'Database connection <*> failed' increased by 7.5x compared to the baseline period, appearing in 15% of logs during 10:00-11:00 versus only 2% in the previous hour. This suggests a database connectivity issue that started around 10:00 AM."



### Advanced Use Cases

#### Security Incident Investigation
```json
{
  "question": "We detected unusual login patterns at 3 AM. Can you analyze our authentication logs to identify potential security threats?"
}
```

The agent would use the Log Pattern Analysis Tool to:
- Compare 3 AM login patterns with normal business hours
- Identify exceptional authentication sequences
- Detect brute force or credential stuffing patterns

#### Performance Degradation Analysis
```json
{
  "question": "Our API response times have increased by 200% since yesterday. What's causing this performance issue?"
}
```

The agent would use the Log Pattern Analysis Tool to:
- Compare current API log patterns with yesterday's baseline using differential analysis
- Identify database query timeout patterns and connection pool exhaustion through pattern recognition
- Correlate slow endpoint sequences with specific user journeys using trace-based sequence analysis
- Detect newly emerged performance bottleneck patterns with statistical significance
