[OpenSearchCon](https://opensearchcon2023.splashthat.com/) is back! The OpenSearch community will get together again September 27-29 to learn, share, and connect about all things search and analytics. The event is in-person only and there is no fee to attend.

We’re making room for more builders and more content by taking over the Sheraton Grand in Seattle. [Special room rates](https://book.passkey.com/event/50584019/owner/346/home) are available for those who wish to stay at the event hotel. OpenSearchCon 2023 passes are limited, so we encourage everyone to [register today](https://opensearchcon2023.splashthat.com/) in order to claim your spot at this year’s conference.

The Call for Papers is still open as well but only until the end of the day on June 16. If you have a story you’d like to share, submit your talk NOW on the [Call for Presentations](https://airtable.com/shrVZLtXJ2d1cI6pT) site - time is of the essence!

OpenSearchCon is for builders, with conference tracks designed to explore and learn more about building applications at scale as an open-source contributor. The current schedule for OpenSearchCon:

* Sept. 27 - Registration and check-in open (come get your swag!!), exhibit hall is open for exhibitors to set up, and afternoon workshops and round table discussions with partners, contributors and users. There will be an evening cocktail reception as well!
* Sept. 28 - Main conference day with three session rooms/tracks, large exhibit hall, opening/closing keynote, and sessions all day. Food/drinks will be served regularly to keep the community going, and dinner in the main room at the end of the day
* Sept. 29th - Half-day on Friday, focused on buttoning up any missed conversations, and a handful more of user and/or partner round table discussions.

This year, we will have three session rooms instead of a single main room. The Search and Analytics tracks will cover a broad range of technology topics, including Open Telemetry, Lucene, Vector Databases, AI/ML, and more. The main stage Community track is where we’ll kick things off with the opening keynote, and will be all about living in the world of open-source software.

First and foremost, this is a community oriented developer meetup - and anyone who wants to become a better builder in this space ought to be there. See you in Seattle!
