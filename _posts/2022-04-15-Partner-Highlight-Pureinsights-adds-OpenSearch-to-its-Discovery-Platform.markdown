[Pureinsights](https://pureinsights.com/) has deep expertise in the design, implementation and management of open source search projects. Our team has undertaken hundreds of projects using Solr and Elasticsearch and we have developed technology assets that enhance these search engines most notably around adding fine grain document understanding pipelines and machine learning model based document vectorizers. On the query side we enable Google BERT based FAQs and Featured Snippets (Extractive Answers) as well as Knowledge Graph Answers (via NEO4J) to OpenSearch applications. We now embrace and add OpenSearch to our stable.

Our Kubernetes, cloud-based [Discovery Platform](https://pureinsights.com/technology/) provides several components that amplify open source search applications including data connectors, content processing, a knowledge graph and a customizable Google like user interface. We significantly enhance the user experience of OpenSearch applications through add-on AI technologies such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) Google BERT based models.

We are pleased to announce that OpenSearch will be the default search engine of choice for the [Pureinsights Discovery Platform](https://pureinsights.com/technology/). 

Pureinsights are a big supporter of the OpenSearch initiative, and we look forward to being an active member of the community. The response to the launch of OpenSearch has been encouraging and we are enthusiastic about its future. We have already seen a slew of new features being added to OpenSearch and the [recent 1.3 release](https://www.opensearch.org/blog/releases/2022/03/launch-announcement-1-3-0/) enables us to enhance our own internal live tele-metrics tracking.    As strong advocates for open source, we look forward to collaborating and contributing towards the project.
