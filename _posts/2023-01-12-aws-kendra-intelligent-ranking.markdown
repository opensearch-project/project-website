OpenSearch partner and contributor [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/gsg.html) recently released Kendra Intelligent Ranking, a new plugin for self-managed OpenSearch deployments that lets users tap into Amazon Kendra’s semantic search capabilities to increase the relevance of search results. With the new plugin, users of open-source OpenSearch version 2.4.0 or later can semantically rerank their search results using Amazon Kendra, which uses machine learning to infer the meaning behind a search query, and compare those results to the default OpenSearch ranker to assess improvements.
