Hi everyone, we’re getting ready for [OpenSearchCon in San Francisco](https://opensearch.org/events/opensearchcon/2024/north-america/index.html) and are thrilled with the level of registrations and talk submissions. Here are a couple of updates about the conference schedule and the call for presentations:

First, the [call for presentations](https://opensearch.org/events/opensearchcon/2024/north-america/cfp.html) is still open until June 28th. We’ll be sending the anonymized submissions through a panel of judges to be scored, sorted, and turned into a high-quality session mix! Please get your submissions in before the deadline as it won’t be extended again.

Also, the conference schedule is forming up nicely and we thought we’d share what’s happening on all three days. Have a look:
