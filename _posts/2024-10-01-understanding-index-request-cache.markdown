Speed and efficiency are essential for search users. OpenSearch achieves these through various mechanisms, one of the most important of which being the [index request cache](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/caching/request-cache/). This blog post describes how this cache is implemented and how it optimizes query performance.

## What is the index request cache?

The index request cache is designed to accelerate search queries in OpenSearch by storing query results at the shard level, as shown in the following image.

Caching frequently run queries reduces the need to re-execute the same query multiple times. This approach is particularly effective for queries targeting specific indexes or patterns, improving response times and overall system efficiency. The cache automatically clears entries when the data changes, ensuring that only up-to-date information is returned.

## Caching policy

Not all search requests are eligible for caching in the index request cache. Search requests that specify `size=0` are cached by default. These requests cache only metadata, such as the total number of results or hits. 

The following requests are ineligible for caching:

* **Non-deterministic requests:** Searches involving functions, like `Math.random()`, or relative times, such as `now` or `new Date()`.
* **Scroll and Profile API requests**
* **DFS query then fetch requests:** This search type depends on both index content and overridden statistics, leading to inaccurate scores when the statistics differ (for example, because of shard updates).

You can enable caching for individual search requests by setting the `request_cache` query parameter to `true`:

```json
GET /students/_search?request_cache=true
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "name": "doe john"
    }
  }
}
```

## Understanding cache entries

Each cache entry is a key-value pair consisting of **Key â†’ BytesReference**.

A [Key](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/4199bc2726235456e5b5422eaf4e836f25c2c5ed/server/src/main/java/org/opensearch/indices/IndicesRequestCache.java#L346) consists of three entities:

1. **CacheEntity:** An [IndexShardCacheEntity](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/4199bc2726235456e5b5422eaf4e836f25c2c5ed/server/src/main/java/org/opensearch/indices/IndicesService.java#L1866C24-L1866C45) contains the [IndexShard](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/server/src/main/java/org/opensearch/index/shard/IndexShard.java). This reference links the key to its shard.
2. **ReaderCacheKeyId:** A unique identifier for the current state of the shard. This reference changes when the shard's state changes (for example, after a document addition, deletion, update, or refresh).
3. **BytesReference:** The actual search query, stored in byte format.

Together, these three components ensure that each key uniquely identifies a specific query targeting a particular shard, as shown in the following diagram. This process also verifies that the shard's state is current, preventing retrieval of stale data.

## Storing entries in the cache

Any cacheable query calls the [`getOrCompute`](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/4199bc2726235456e5b5422eaf4e836f25c2c5ed/server/src/main/java/org/opensearch/indices/IndicesRequestCache.java#L223) method, which either fetches a precomputed value from the cache or stores the result in the cache after computation.


The following is the implementation of the `getOrCompute` method:

```javascript
function getOrCompute(CacheEntity, DirectoryReader, cacheKey) {
    // Step 1: Get the current state identifier of the shard
    readerCacheKeyId = DirectoryReader.getDelegatingCacheKey().getId()

    // Step 2: Create a unique key for the cache entry
    key = new Key(CacheEntity, cacheKey, readerCacheKeyId)

    // Step 3: Check if the result is already in the cache
    value = cache.computeIfAbsent(key)
    
    // Step 4: If the result was computed (not retrieved from the cache), register a cleanup listener
    if (cacheLoader.isLoaded()) {
        cleanupKey = new CleanupKey(CacheEntity, readerCacheKeyId)
        OpenSearchDirectoryReader.addReaderCloseListener(DirectoryReader, cleanupKey)
    }

    // Step 5: Return the cached or computed result
    return value
}
```

## Cache invalidation

An `IndexReader` provides a point-in-time view of an index. Any operation that modifies the index's contents creates a new `IndexReader` and closes the old one. Cache entries created by the old `IndexReader` then become stale and must be cleaned up.

### CleanupKey

A `CleanupKey` corresponds to a `Key` to be deleted. The relationship between them is shown in the following diagram.

![CleanupKey](/assets/media/blog-images/2024-10-01-understanding-index-request-cache/key_and_cleanupkey.png)
{:class="img-centered" style="width:700px;"}

When an `IndexReader` is closed, the corresponding `CleanupKey` is added to a set called `KeysToClean`.

**BytesReference** is not used by the `CleanupKey` because it represents the cached data itself, which is not needed to identify which entries should be cleaned up. The `CleanupKey` only identifies the entries to be removed and is not concerned with their contents.

A cache entry can become invalid because of the following operations:

- **Refresh/merge**: A `refresh` or `merge` operation creates a new `IndexReader`, thereby invalidating the cache entry.
- **Clear cache**: A clear cache API operation invalidates all request cache entries for the specified index. You can call the Clear Cache API as follows:
  ```bash
  POST /my-index/_cache/clear?request=true
  ```

Any operation that invalidates an `IndexReader` or explicitly clears the cache add a corresponding `CleanupKey` to a collection called `KeysToClean`, as shown in the following diagram.

## Cache cleanup

Every minute, OpenSearch runs a background job called [CacheCleaner](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/server/src/main/java/org/opensearch/indices/IndicesService.java#L1678) on a separate thread. This job calls the [`cleanCache`](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/server/src/main/java/org/opensearch/indices/IndicesRequestCache.java#L698) method, which iterates through all cache entries, maps each `Key` to a `CleanupKey` in `KeysToClean`, and removes the corresponding entries, as shown in the following diagram.

![Cache-Clear](/assets/media/blog-images/2024-10-01-understanding-index-request-cache/keys_to_clean_delete_and_fetch.png){:class="img-centered" style="width:650px;"}

The following is the implementation of the `cleanCache` method:

```javascript
function cleanCache() {
    // Step 1: Initialize sets for keys to clean
    currentKeysToClean = new Set()
    currentFullClean = new Set()

    // Step 2: Process the list of keys that need to be cleaned
    for each cleanupKey in keysToClean {
        keysToClean.remove(cleanupKey)
        if (shard is closed or cacheClearAPI called) {
            currentFullClean.add(cleanupKey.entity.getCacheIdentity())
        } else {
            currentKeysToClean.add(cleanupKey)
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Process the cache and remove identified keys
    for each key in cache.keys() {
        if (currentFullClean.contains(key.entity.getCacheIdentity()) or 
            currentKeysToClean.contains(new CleanupKey(key.entity, key.readerCacheKey))) {
            cache.remove(key)
        }
    }

    // Step 4: Refresh the cache
    cache.refresh()
}
```
