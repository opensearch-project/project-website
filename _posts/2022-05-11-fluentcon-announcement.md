# FluentCon EU 2022

The Fluent community is excited to partner with the OpenSearch community in hosting another installment of FluentCon. The conference is a co-located event alongside [KubeCon Europe](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/) on May 16th in Valencia, Spain, as well as virtually from your laptop. Similar to previous FluentCons, this event will feature both general sessions as well as in-depth workshops focused on core use cases, strategies for managing observability at scale, and conversation on how we build forward.

We are also excited to have the OpenSearch community front and center, with a keynote around getting started with a keynote by [Eli Fisher](https://opensearch.org/authors/elifish/) titled [End-to-End Log Analytics: Using the OpenSearch Project and Fluent](https://fluentconeu22.sched.com/event/zh6Z?iframe=no).

You can check out the rest of the [FluentCon EU 2022 schedule](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/fluentcon-europe/program/schedule/) that includes talks by other community members such as IBM, Microsoft, Asana, Medtronic, Amazon Web Services.

If this is your first FluentCon or KubeCon event experience, we welcome you to check out [FluentCon NA session recordings from 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suk3M56WVRE&list=PLj6h78yzYM2NvAExF3TiqIwfdP9SThOM0). These include amazing presentations from users at Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, Fidelity, Neiman Marcus, Greynoise Intelligence, and more.

## Registration
Users attending in-person can add a [FluentCon Ticket](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/fluentcon-europe/register/) to your KubeCon Europe pass as part of registration, for an additional fee, and users attending virtually can access FluentCon on the day of the event.


## Getting Involved
Canâ€™t make the conference but still want to get involved? We will discuss all the sessions in the next [Fluent Community meeting](https://www.meetup.com/fluent-community-meeting/) and will post updates throughout the week in the [Fluent Slack channel](https://slack.fluentd.org).
