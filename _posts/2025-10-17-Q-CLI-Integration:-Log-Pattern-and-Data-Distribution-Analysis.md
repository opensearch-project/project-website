## Log Pattern Analysis Tool Overview

The [Log Pattern Analysis Tool](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/ml-commons-plugin/agents-tools/tools/log-pattern-analysis-tool/) is an OpenSearch agent tool that automates log analysis through multiple analysis modes. It performs differential pattern analysis between baseline and problem periods, analyzes log sequences using trace correlation, and provides log insights by automatically extracting error patterns and keywords from log data to accelerate troubleshooting.

## Data Distribution Tool Overview

The [Data Distribution Tool](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/ml-commons-plugin/agents-tools/tools/data-distribution-tool/) is an OpenSearch agent tool that analyzes data distribution patterns within datasets and compares distributions between different time periods. It supports both single dataset analysis and comparative analysis to identify significant changes in field value distributions, helping detect anomalies, trends, and data quality issues. The tool generates statistical summaries including value frequencies, percentiles, and distribution metrics to help understand data characteristics and identify potential data quality issues.

## Amazon Q CLI Integration

Amazon Q CLI can seamlessly integrate with these OpenSearch analysis tools through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://opensearch.org/blog/introducing-mcp-in-opensearch/). By configuring the OpenSearch MCP server, you can access both the Log Pattern Analysis Tool and Data Distribution Tool directly from your command line interface. This integration enables natural language queries for log analysis and data distribution insights, making complex diagnostic tasks accessible through simple conversational commands.

### Implementation with opensearch-mcp-server-py

This integration is built on the [opensearch-mcp-server-py](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-mcp-server-py) project, which provides a Python-based MCP server for OpenSearch. To enable the Log Pattern Analysis Tool and Data Distribution Tool integration, you need to clone this project and add custom integration code for both tools, extending the server's capabilities to support these advanced analysis features.

### Complete Integration Workflow

To set up Amazon Q CLI with OpenSearch MCP integration, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the MCP Server Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-mcp-server-py.git
   cd opensearch-mcp-server-py
   ```

2. **Add Tool Integration Code**
   - Implement Log Pattern Analysis Tool integration in the MCP server
   - Implement Data Distribution Tool integration in the MCP server
   - Register both tools with the MCP server's tool registry
   - For a complete implementation example, see the demo at [opensearch-mcp-server-py/integrate-skill-tool](https://github.com/PauiC/opensearch-mcp-server-py/tree/integrate-skill-tool)

3. **Start the MCP Server**
   ```bash
   OPENSEARCH_URL="<your-opensearch-cluster-endpoint>" \
   OPENSEARCH_USERNAME="<your-opensearch-username>" \
   OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD="<your-opensearch-password>" \
   python -m src.mcp_server_opensearch --transport stream --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9900
   ```
   
   This command starts the MCP server on localhost:9900. When using this configuration, set the `url` field in your configuration file to: `"http://localhost:9900/mcp"`

4. **Configure Amazon Q CLI**
   - Open your Amazon Q CLI configuration file
   - Add the MCP server configuration (see below)

5. **Start Using Natural Language Queries**
   - Launch Amazon Q CLI
   - Begin querying your OpenSearch data using conversational commands

### MCP Configuration Example

To configure the OpenSearch MCP server for Amazon Q CLI, add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opensearch-mcp-server": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "<your-mcp-server-url>",
      "env": {
        "OPENSEARCH_URL": "<your-opensearch-cluster-endpoint>",
        "OPENSEARCH_USERNAME": "<your-opensearch-username>",
        "OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD": "<your-opensearch-password>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Configuration Notes:**
- `url`: Replace with your MCP server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:9900/mcp`)
- `OPENSEARCH_URL`: Replace with your OpenSearch cluster endpoint
- `OPENSEARCH_PASSWORD`: Replace with your OpenSearch password
- `OPENSEARCH_USERNAME`: Replace with your OpenSearch username

## Real-World Example: OpenTelemetry Demo

To demonstrate the practical application of these integrated tools, we'll use the OpenTelemetry Demo as our example scenario. OpenTelemetry is an observability framework that provides a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs for generating, collecting, and exporting telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) from applications. The OpenTelemetry Demo simulates a realistic e-commerce platform with multiple microservices including cart service, checkout service, payment service, and recommendation engine. In this environment, common issues arise such as payment processing failures, cart abandonment errors, recommendation service timeouts, and checkout workflow disruptions, providing excellent opportunities for root cause analysis in a distributed system environment.

### Investigating Payment Failures

In our scenario, users are reporting payment failures during checkout - a critical issue impacting revenue and customer experience. We choose payment failures as our root cause analysis target due to their business-critical impact. The OpenTelemetry Demo can simulate various failure conditions, including payment service disruptions and authentication issues. To resolve this issue, we need to analyze the logs to identify failure patterns and determine whether the issue is related to specific customer segments, authentication problems, or system-level configuration issues.

### Amazon Q CLI Investigation Process

Using Amazon Q CLI with the integrated OpenSearch tools, we can investigate this issue through natural language queries. Here's how the investigation unfolds:

**Initial Query:**
```
Users are reporting payment failures during checkout process and we need to investigate the root cause by analyzing logs from the ss4o_logs* index between 2025-08-21 3pm and 4pm to identify patterns in checkout service failures related to card charging issues.
```

**Amazon Q CLI Analysis Results:**
```
I'll help you investigate the payment failures by analyzing the logs from the ss4o_logs* index during the specified time period. Let me start by examining the available indices and then analyze the checkout service failures.

> Based on my comprehensive analysis of the checkout service logs from August 21st, 2025 between 3-4 PM, here are the key findings regarding payment failures:
> 
> ## Root Cause Analysis Summary
> 
> ### Primary Issue: Invalid Payment Token Errors
> • **792 total payment-related failures** during the 1-hour period
> • **189 specific "Invalid token" errors** from the checkout service
> • **63 instances** of the exact pattern: "Payment request failed. Invalid token. app.loyalty.level=gold"
> 
> ### Key Patterns Identified
> 
> 1. Payment Token Validation Failure
>    • Primary error: "could not charge the card: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Payment request failed. Invalid token"
>    • All failures consistently show app.loyalty.level=gold, suggesting the issue specifically affects gold-tier loyalty customers
> 
> 2. Error Distribution Timeline
>    • Peak failure periods: 15:20-15:25 (82 failures) and 15:45-15:50 (79 failures)
>    • Consistent failure rate throughout the hour (50-80 failures per 5-minute interval)
>    • **533 successful transactions** occurred during the same period, indicating partial system functionality
> 
> 3. Service Impact Breakdown
>    • **Checkout service**: 471 failures (primary affected service)
>    • **Kafka service**: 188 failures (likely downstream effects)
>    • **Ad service**: 133 failures (secondary impact)
> 
> ### Secondary Issues
> • **19 product catalog failures**: "failed to get product #OLJCESPC7Z" indicating inventory system problems
> • Multiple trace IDs affected, suggesting widespread rather than isolated incidents
> 
> ### Recommendations
> 
> 1. Immediate Actions
>    • Investigate payment token generation/validation service for gold loyalty customers
>    • Check payment gateway integration for token handling issues
>    • Verify loyalty program integration with payment processing
> 
> 2. System Investigation
>    • Review payment service logs for token generation failures
>    • Check authentication/authorization services for gold-tier customers
>    • Examine any recent changes to loyalty program or payment processing logic
> 
> 3. Monitoring Enhancement
>    • Implement specific alerts for payment token validation failures
>    • Add loyalty-level segmentation to payment monitoring
>    • Set up proactive monitoring for checkout service error rates
> 
> The data clearly shows a systematic issue with payment token validation specifically affecting gold loyalty customers, requiring immediate attention to the payment processing pipeline.

#### Log Pattern Analysis Tool's Role in This Investigation

**Core Contribution: Automated Error Pattern Recognition**

The Log Pattern Analysis Tool played a crucial pattern identification role in this payment failure investigation:

1. **Primary Failure Pattern Identification** (63 occurrences):
   - Automatically identified three related patterns for payment token validation failures
   - All patterns point to the same root cause: `Payment request failed. Invalid token`
   - Specifically identified that failures are associated with `app.loyalty.level=gold`

2. **Secondary Failure Pattern Identification** (19 occurrences):
   - Identified two product catalog-related failure patterns
   - Pattern: `failed to get product #"<*>Z"`
   - Provided specific product ID examples: `OLJCESPC7Z`

3. **Pattern Classification and Quantification**:
   - Automatically grouped related error messages into logical failure categories
   - Provided exact occurrence count statistics
   - Delivered actual log samples for each pattern for validation

**Value Delivered**: This tool eliminated the need for manual pattern recognition, automatically discovering that payment token validation failures occur 3.3 times more frequently than product catalog issues, clearly establishing primary vs. secondary failure mode priorities.

#### Data Distribution Tool's Role in This Investigation

**Core Contribution: Statistical Analysis and Context Provision**

The Data Distribution Tool provided critical statistical background and field distribution analysis for the investigation:

1. **Service Distribution Analysis** (divergence: 0.223):
   - kafka: 22% (highest log volume service)
   - product-catalog: 18% (secondary failure source)
   - frontend-proxy: 15% (user-facing errors)
   - checkout: 13% (primary failure point)
   - load-generator: 11%
   - Other services: 21%

2. **Severity Level Analysis** (divergence: 0.609):
   - INFO level: 61% (normal operations)
   - Error level: Only 1% (concentrated failures)
   - Empty values: 18%
   - info level: 12%
   - Information level: 8%

3. **Field Anomaly Detection**:
   - `droppedAttributesCount`: divergence = 1.0 (complete anomaly)
   - `severityNumber`: divergence = 0.689 (high anomaly)
   - `flags`: divergence = 0.594 (moderate anomaly)
   - `schemaUrl`: divergence = 0.573 (moderate anomaly)

**Value Delivered**: This tool revealed that despite checkout service representing only 13% of total logs, it contains the highest concentration of critical failures. The severity distribution showed that error-level logs are rare (1%), making the 63 payment failures statistically significant. This quantitative context helped prioritize checkout service investigation over higher-volume but less critical services like kafka.

#### Synergistic Effect of Both Tools

1. **Qualitative + Quantitative Analysis**: Log Pattern Analysis Tool provided specific error patterns, Data Distribution Tool provided statistical validation
2. **Priority Guidance**: Combined analysis showed checkout service has disproportionately high failure impact despite lower log volume
3. **Root Cause Validation**: Both tools confirmed payment token validation as the primary issue, with product catalog as secondary
4. **Actionable Insights**: Together provided specific error messages and statistical significance, supporting clear remediation recommendations

This investigation demonstrates Q CLI's orchestration of multiple OpenSearch tools: ListIndexTool and IndexMappingTool for data discovery, SearchIndexTool for targeted queries, DataDistributionTool for statistical analysis of field patterns, CountTool for quantitative assessment, and LogPatternAnalysisTool for automated pattern extraction. The Log Pattern Analysis Tool provided precise error pattern identification with exact occurrence counts (63 payment failures, 19 product catalog issues), while the Data Distribution Tool offered statistical context that validated the significance of checkout service failures despite lower log volume. The combination generated a comprehensive root cause analysis that pinpointed invalid payment tokens as the primary issue affecting gold-tier customers, complete with actionable recommendations for token validation, service dependencies, and monitoring improvements.

## Conclusion

The integration of Q CLI with OpenSearch's Log Pattern Analysis Tool and Data Distribution Tool transforms complex log investigation into conversational analysis. Through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), these tools become accessible via natural language queries, significantly reducing diagnostic complexity.

**Key Benefits Demonstrated:**

1. **Conversational Interface**: Complex log analysis through natural language queries
2. **Automated Pattern Recognition**: No manual log parsing or pattern identification required
3. **Statistical Validation**: Quantitative analysis supporting qualitative findings
4. **Comprehensive Investigation**: Multiple tool orchestration in single conversation
5. **Actionable Results**: Clear root cause identification with specific recommendations

Together, these tools delivered comprehensive root cause analysis through simple conversational commands, transforming what traditionally required multiple manual queries and domain expertise into an automated, intelligent investigation process. This integration makes advanced log analysis accessible to broader audiences while significantly reducing time to resolution in distributed system troubleshooting.
