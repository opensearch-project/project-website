[Instaclustr](https://www.instaclustr.com) is pleased to announce the general availability of OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards on the Instaclustr SaaS Platform. OpenSearch is another key open source technology that joins our suite of managed offerings.  Instaclustr also provides Enterprise Support for organizations who choose to run OpenSearch themselves.

We are pleased to support the OpenSearch initiative and believe that it is vital that the community work together to ensure a viable, open alternative to increasingly proprietary offerings from Elastic.co.

Our Managed OpenSearch offering builds on the operational knowledge developed from our Open Distro for Elasticsearch offering. In March 2020, Instaclustr was the first company to offer Managed Service for Open Distro for Elasticsearch besides AWSâ€™ own service (as the original sponsors of the Open Distro). Instaclustr Managed OpenSearch is available on AWS, GCP, Azure and your own infrastructure (including on-prem).

If you are running Elasticsearch clusters and are concerned about the licence changes we highly encourage you to trial an OpenSearch cluster and experiment with it. You can begin a free trial of Instaclustr Managed OpenSearch [here](https://console.instaclustr.com/user/signup).
