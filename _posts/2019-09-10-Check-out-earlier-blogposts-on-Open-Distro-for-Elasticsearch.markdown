<b>Add Single Sign-On (SSO) to Open Distro for Elasticsearch Kibana Using SAML and Okta</b>

by Jagadeesh Pusapadi, Aug 16 2019

Open Distro for Elasticsearch Security implements the web browser single sign-on (SSO) profile of the SAML 2.0 protocol. This enables you to configure federated access with any SAML 2.0 compliant identity provider (IdP). In a prior post, I discussed setting up SAML-based SSO using Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS). In this post, I’ll cover the Okta-specific configuration.

<b>Demystifying Elasticsearch Shard Allocation</b>

by Vigya Sharma and Jon Handler, Aug 13 2019

At the core of Open Distro for Elasticsearch’s ability to provide a seamless scaling experience, lies its ability distribute its workload across machines. This is achieved via sharding. When you create an index you set a primary and replica shard count for that index. Elasticsearch distributes your data and requests across those shards, and the shards across your data nodes.

<b>Use Elasticsearch’s rollover API For Efficient Storage Distribution</b>

by Jon Handler, Aug 06 2019

Many Open Distro for Elasticsearch users manage data life cycle in their clusters by creating an index based on a standard time period, usually one index per day. This pattern has many advantages - ingest tools like Logstash support index rollover out of the box; defining a retention window is straightforward; and deleting old data is as simple as dropping an index.

<b>Manage Your Open Distro for Elasticsearch Alerting Monitors With odfe-monitor-cli</b>

by Mihir Soni, Jun 12 2019

When you use Open Distro for Elasticsearch Alerting, you create monitors in Kibana. Setting up monitors with a UI is fast and convenient, making it easy to get started. If monitoring is a major workload for your cluster, though, you may have hundreds or even thousands of monitors to create, update, and tune over time. Setting so many monitors using the Kibana UI would be time-consuming and tedious.

<b>Set up Multi-Tenant Kibana Access in Open Distro for Elasticsearch</b>

by Jon Handler, Jun 04 2019

Elasticsearch has become a default choice for storing and analyzing log data to deliver insights on your application’s performance, your security stance, and your users’ interactions with your application. It’s so useful that many teams adopt Elasticsearch early in their development cycle to support DevOps. This grass-roots adoption often mushrooms into a confusing set of clusters and users across a large organization.

<b>Store Open Distro for Elasticsearch’s Performance Analyzer Output in Elasticsearch</b>

by Jon Handler, May 25 2019

Open Distro for Elasticsearch‘s Performance Analyzer plugin exposes a REST API that returns metrics from your Elasticsearch cluster. To get the most out of these metrics, you can store them in Elasticsearch and use Kibana to visualize them. While you can use Open Distro for Elasticsearch’s PerfTop to build visualizations, PerfTop doesn’t retain data and is meant to be lightweight.

<b>Run Rally with Open Distro for Elasticsearch</b>

by Atri Sharma and Jon Handler, May 09 2019

It’s hard to size and scale an Elasticsearch cluster. You need to have sufficient storage for your data, but your mappings and the contents of the data are key components to your data’s size on disk. You need capacity for your queries and updates, but the amounts of CPU, JVM, disk, and network bandwidth you use are critically dependent on the queries you run and the updates you send.

<b>Lightweight Debugging with Performance Analyzer and PerfTop in Open Distro for Elasticsearch</b>

by Jon Handler, Apr 12 2019

When you want to monitor your Elasticsearch cluster or debug an issue, you have a number of choices. You can use the various cat and stats APIs to pull information out of the cluster. You can monitor and profile the JVM itself. These options can be cumbersome, and they lack visual displays. While you could push cat and stats data back into Elasticsearch and visualize with Kibana, sometimes you want a more lightweight method.
