In the world of search and analytics, performance is everything. As an engineer, you need to ensure that your search queries are not only fast but also resource efficient. However, understanding what's happening in your search operations internally can be challenging. That's where OpenSearch's new feature, Query Insights, comes into play. This tool is designed to give you deeper visibility into the performance of your search queries, helping you identify bottlenecks, optimize performance, and, ultimately, provide a better experience for your users.


### What is Query Insights?

Query Insights is a comprehensive framework within OpenSearch that provides detailed visibility into the execution of search queries. It collects and analyzes data on the performance of each query, offering you the tools to identify the top resource-consuming queries, understand query latency, and track the source of queries. This feature is invaluable for troubleshooting, optimizing performance, and ensuring the smooth operation of your search environment.


### Why is Query Insights important?

Understanding the performance of your search queries is critical for maintaining a responsive and efficient search platform. With Query Insights, you can quickly identify the top queries that are consuming the most CPU or memory or are exhibiting high latency. This allows you to focus your optimization efforts where they are needed most. By using Query Insights, you can:


* **Identify performance bottlenecks:** Easily spot queries that are slowing down your system, whether due to high resource usage or inefficient execution.
* **Optimize resource allocation:** Gain insights into how resources are being utilized, enabling you to make informed decisions about shard rebalancing or scaling.
* **Enhance troubleshooting:** With detailed metadata and query execution stages, you can drill down into specific nodes or tasks to pinpoint the root cause of performance issues.

### Key features of Query Insights

1. **Top N queries:** One of the most requested features is the ability to identify the top queries by latency, CPU usage, or memory consumption. This feature allows you to focus on optimizing the queries that have the most significant impact on your system's performance.
2. **Detailed query metadata:** Each query record includes essential information such as the timestamp, source, involved indexes, node ID, and task-level resource usage. This data is crucial for understanding the context of each query and making informed decisions about optimizations.
3. **Query exporter:** The Query Insights framework includes an exporter that allows you to save query performance data to local indexes or a data lake. This historical data can be invaluable for investigating past performance issues, such as CPU spikes or node drops.
4. **Upcoming dashboard integration:** An upcoming feature is the Query Insights dashboard, which will offer a visual representation of the top queries and their performance metrics. This dashboard will make it even easier to monitor and analyze query performance over time.



### Architecture

The Query Insights architecture includes the new Query Insights plugin, additional OpenSearch components, and the integration of existing components to collect metrics, delivering comprehensive insights and recommendations. At a high level, the Query Insights framework comprises the following integral components:

* **Collectors**: These components gather performance-related data at various stages of search query execution.
* **Processors**: Built into the Query Insights plugin, these components perform lightweight aggregation and processing on data gathered by the collectors.
* **Customer experience:** Various user interaction points, such as APIs, dashboards, metrics, and exporters, facilitate the presentation of insights and recommendations to users.

The interactions among these components are shown in the following architecture diagram.

### Examples

To better illustrate the power of Query Insights, let's explore some practical use cases and see how this tool can streamline your search optimization efforts.

### Example 1: Identify resource-intensive queries (top N queries by CPU usage)

**Scenario**: You notice that your OpenSearch cluster is experiencing high CPU usage. To investigate, you want to track the top N queries by CPU usage within a 30-minute window.

**Steps**:

1. **Enable top N query monitoring by CPU**:
  ```json
  PUT _cluster/settings
  {
    "persistent" : {
      "search.insights.top_queries.cpu.enabled" : true
    }
  }
  ```
1. **Set the monitoring window size to 30 minutes**:
  ```json
  PUT _cluster/settings
  {
    "persistent" : {
      "search.insights.top_queries.cpu.window_size" : "30m"
    }
  }
  ```
1. **Set N to 10 to track the top 10 queries**:
  ```json
  PUT _cluster/settings
  {
    "persistent" : {
      "search.insights.top_queries.cpu.top_n_size" : 10
    }
  }
  ```
1. **Retrieve the top N queries by CPU**:
  ```json
  GET /_insights/top_queries?type=cpu
  ```

The response returns the 10 queries that used the most CPU resources within the last 30 minutes, helping you identify which queries to optimize.

### Example 2: Diagnose slow search queries (top N queries by latency)

**Scenario**: Your users are reporting slow search queries, and you need to find the most time-consuming queries executed in the last hour.

**Steps**:

1. **Enable top N query monitoring by latency**:
  ```json
  PUT _cluster/settings
  {
    "persistent" : {
      "search.insights.top_queries.latency.enabled" : true
    }
  }
  ```
1. **Set the monitoring window size to 1 hour**:
  ```json
  PUT _cluster/settings
  {
    "persistent" : {
      "search.insights.top_queries.latency.window_size" : "60m"
    }
  }
  ```
1. **Set N to track the top 5 queries by latency**:
  ```json
  PUT _cluster/settings
  {
    "persistent" : {
      "search.insights.top_queries.latency.top_n_size" : 5
    }
  }
  ```
1. **Retrieve the top N queries by latency**:
  ```json
  GET /_insights/top_queries?type=latency
  ```


The response provides a list of the five slowest queries executed in the last hour, allowing you to investigate further.


### Example 3: Group similar queries for better analysis (top N queries by similarity)

**Scenario**: A single query is executed multiple times with small variations, preventing other resource-heavy queries from appearing in the top N query list. You want to group similar queries based on their structure.

**Steps**:

1. **Enable top N query monitoring by CPU or latency**:
  ```json
  PUT _cluster/settings
  {
    "persistent" : {
      "search.insights.top_queries.cpu.enabled" : true
    }
  }
  ```
1. **Enable query grouping by similarity**:
  ```json
  PUT _cluster/settings
  {
    "persistent" : {
      "search.insights.top_queries.group_by" : "similarity"
    }
  }
  ```
1. **Optionally, limit the number of monitored query groups**:
  ```json
  PUT _cluster/settings
  {
    "persistent" : {
      "search.insights.top_queries.max_groups_excluding_topn" : 100
    }
  }
  ```
1. **Retrieve the top N query groups**:
  ```json
  GET /_insights/top_queries
  ```

By grouping similar queries, you ensure that the results contain a greater variety of queries, making it easier to identify other resource-intensive queries.


### Example 4: Export Query Insights data for offline analysis

**Scenario**: You want to export top N query data to local indexes for offline analysis.

**Steps**:

1. **Enable top N query monitoring (for example, by latency)**:
  ```json
  PUT _cluster/settings
  {
    "persistent" : {
      "search.insights.top_queries.latency.enabled" : true
    }
  }
  ```
1. **Configure a local index exporter**:
  ```json
  PUT _cluster/settings
  {
    "persistent" : {
      "search.insights.top_queries.latency.exporter.type" : "local_index",
      "search.insights.top_queries.latency.exporter.config.index" : "top_queries-YYYY.MM.dd"
    }
  }
  ```

This request will store daily top N query data in your local index, allowing for extended historical analysis.
