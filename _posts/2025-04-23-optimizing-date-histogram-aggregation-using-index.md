meta_description: The journey of optimizaing date histogram aggregation using index
---

OpenSearch is frequently utilized for data analytics, especially with time-series data. A cornerstone of time-series analysis is the date histogram aggregation, which groups documents by date or timestamp into defined intervals like months, weeks, or days. This grouping is crucial for visualizing trends and patterns, such as viewing the hourly number of HTTP requests to a website.
However, as data volume grows, the computation required for these aggregations can slow down analysis and dashboard responsiveness. Traditionally, this involved iterating over every relevant document to place it into the correct time bucket, a method that becomes inefficient at scale. To address this, OpenSearch introduced optimizations that leverage the underlying index structure of date fields for significantly faster aggregation performance. This post details the evolution of this optimization.

### Why Optimize? Use Cases and Benefits

Optimizing date histogram performance offers several advantages across various scenarios:

* Use Cases: Analyzing web traffic patterns, monitoring application metrics and logs, visualizing sales trends, tracking IoT sensor data, etc.
* Benefits:
    * Faster Analysis: Reduces dashboard load times for time-series visualizations.
    * Improved Scalability: Handles large data volumes more effectively without sacrificing performance.

### How it Works: Leveraging the Index Tree

To understand the optimization, it helps to know how OpenSearch (via Lucene) stores numeric data like timestamps. Data exists in two main structures:

1. Document Values: A column-oriented structure optimized for operations like sorting and aggregations. The traditional method iterates over these values.
2. Index Tree (BKD Tree): A specialized index structure (a one-dimensional BKD tree for date fields) designed for fast range filtering. It consists of inner nodes and leaf nodes. Values are stored only in leaf nodes, while inner nodes store the bounding ranges of their children. This structure allows efficient traversal in sorted order to find documents within specific ranges.

The optimization shifts date histogram aggregation from iterating document values to utilizing the BKD tree's ability to count documents within the date ranges defined by the histogram buckets.

### The Optimization Journey

#### Phase 1: The Filter Rewrite Approach (OpenSearch 2.12)

The initial optimization introduced a filter rewrite strategy. It preemptively created a series of range filters, one for each bucket in the requested date histogram. For example, a monthly histogram over a year would generate 12 filters. 

```json
{
  "aggs": {
    "by_month": {
      "date_histogram": {
        "field": "@timestamp",
        "calendar_interval": "month"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

These filters could then leverage the BKD tree to determine counts for each bucket faster than document value iteration. This approach was also applied to auto date histogram, composite aggregation on date histogram source and later on, numeric range aggregation provided with consecutive ranges.

#### Phase 2: Addressing Scalability with Multi-Range Traversal (OpenSearch 2.14)

While effective in many cases, the filter rewrite approach faced challenges. A performance regression was observed in [13087](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/13087), particularly when the number of buckets became very large (i.e., small intervals). The overhead of managing numerous filters and the increased likelihood of needing to access leaf nodes in the BKD tree could negate the benefits.
To overcome this, "multi-range traversal" was developed. Recognizing that all filters operate on the same index, this method traverses the BKD tree just once, efficiently counting documents for all required bucket ranges in a single pass. This resolved the reported regression and provided additional performance improvements.

#### Phase 3: Expanding Support for Sub-Aggregations (OpenSearch 3.0)

Initially, the optimization only applied to top-level date histograms. However, users frequently need sub-aggregations within time buckets, such as calculating average metrics or counting distinct values (e.g., average network bandwidth per hour, counts of HTTP status codes). Support for these sub-aggregations was added in OpenSearch 3.0. Protections were implemented during development to prevent regressions identified in testing.

### Performance Results Summary

The optimizations have yielded significant performance gains:

* [Filter Rewrite](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/pull/11083#issuecomment-1820937321) (v2.12): 10x to 50x improvements observed on specific date histogram queries compared to the baseline.
* [Multi-Range Traversal](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/pull/13317) (v2.14): Resolved regressions and achieved further gains, including up to 70% on the http_logs workload and 20-40% on nyc_taxis compared to the filter rewrite method.
* [Sub-Aggregation Support](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/pull/17447) (v3.0): 30-40% improvements observed for relevant operations in the big5 workload.

### Limitations and Caveats

* The filter rewrite optimization primarily worked with match_all queries or simple range queries compatible with the index tree computation; it does not support arbitrary top-level queries. While [segment level match all](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/pull/12073) is supported later, complex query interactions might still limit applicability.
* While multi-range traversal significantly reduced overhead, extremely fine-grained histograms over sparse datasets could potentially still encounter performance regressions.

### Conclusion

The index-based optimization for date histogram aggregations in OpenSearch significantly enhances the performance of time-series analysis and visualization. It applies automatically to eligible aggregations, streamlining workflows without extra user effort. As OpenSearch evolves, such improvements ensure users can efficiently gain insights from their data, with less concern about scale.
