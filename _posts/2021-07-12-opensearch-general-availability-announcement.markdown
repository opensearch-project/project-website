**OpenSearch General Availability Release**

Today the OpenSearch community has achieved a major milestone by shipping OpenSearch 1.0 and OpenSearch Dashboards 1.0, our first generally available releases. Not only does general availability marks a major milestone for the OpenSearch community but means OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards are production ready! Features contained with this release include;

* Advanced Security
* SQL Query Syntax
* Anomaly Detection
* Alerting
* Piped Processing Language

…and more ([OpenSearch](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch) and [OpenSearch Dashboards](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards)).

In addition to the downloadable [artifacts](https://opensearch.org/downloads.html) released with beta, the 1.0.0 release will include ARM64 artifacts (TAR ARM64, Docker ARM64) that also include OpenSearch plugins (Linux tars, Docker images). Based on community [feedback](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/issues/31), GA also includes the release of standalone, minimal downloadable artifacts without OpenSearch plugins. 

**Special Thanks**

This release includes a number of code contributions from the community and would not have been possible without all of the great community feedback we have received via GitHub and elsewhere. We can’t thank our community enough and are looking forward to working with all of you as we continue to build OpenSearch into the best search and analytics suite available. 

[LIST OF CONTRIBUTORS TBD]

We’d also like to share a special thanks to the [OpenSearch partners](https://opensearch.org/partners/) who have helped make OpenSearch 1.0 possible: [Aiven](https://aiven.io/), [Appbase.io](http://appbase.io/), [Bitergia](https://bitergia.com/), [Bonsai](https://bonsai.io/), [Eliatra](https://eliatra.com/), [Instaclustr](https://www.instaclustr.com/), [Logz.io](https://logz.io/), and [Titaniam](https://www.titaniamlabs.com/).

If I have missed anyone on this list, please reach out and I will very gratefully make an addition!

**What’s next?**

The next milestone for OpenSearch is 1.1 expected to be release August 30. In addition to more artifact coverage (ex. RPM X64, DEB X64, DEB ARM64), OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards 1.1 will include improvements to anomaly detection (ex. [universal flow](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/anomaly-detection/issues/380), [indexing pressure protection](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/478), and [notification support](https://github.com/opensearch-project/notifications/issues/181) among others. Please check out the public roadmap for more details and the roadmap [FAQ](https://opensearch.org/faq/#q1.19) that provide guidance on contributing. 

**How can you help?**

As always, the biggest thing you can do to help is join us! You can install ([OpenSearch](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) and [OpenSearch Dashboards](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/blob/main/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)) and start diving in! Feel free to take a look around at what we’ve been up to, and then head over to look at the open issues. Or you could jump right in and start opening issues or contributing (for more details see [here](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)). Please feel free to use, modify, extend, embed, monetize, resell, and offer OpenSearch as you see fit! 

For almost any type of contribution, the first step is opening an issue ([OpenSearch](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues), [OpenSearch Dashboards](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/issues)). Even if you think you already know what the solution is, writing down a description of the problem you’re trying to solve will help everyone get context when they review your pull request. If it’s truly a trivial change (e.g. spelling error), you can skip this step – but as the subject says, when it doubt, open an issue. If you’re excited to jump in, check out the ["help wanted"](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) tag in issues. 

**Questions? Feedback?**

Let us know in by opening an [issue](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues) or posting in the [forums](https://discuss.opendistrocommunity.dev/). We are also having biweekly [Community Meetings](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Distro-for-Elasticsearch-Meetup-Group/). The community meetings will include progress updates at every session as well as leaving time for Q&A. The next community meeting is on Monday, July 26, 2021 from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM PDT.
