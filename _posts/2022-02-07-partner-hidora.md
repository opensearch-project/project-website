Why choosing Hidora for your OpenSearch hosting?
=================================================

With our partner Jelastic, we have integrated the deployment of the OpenSearch stack in every detail. We are currently able to offer you version 1.2.3. Also, redeploy functionality provides a simple update process. You can scale your OpenSearch cluster, extend the storage, add nodes in few seconds.



One click installation with the Topology wizard!
-------------------------------------------------

Take advantage of our customization interface to define the architecture of your cluster:

*   Activate or not OpenSearch-Dashboard and Logstash
*   Define how many nodes will be create on OpenSearch cluster
*   Assign public IPv4 or IPv6 or manage access through our Shared Load Balancer (SLB)
*   Scale nodes resources by managing in real time Cloudlet assignation



After being created, the OpenSearch node is available on port _9200_ for internal communication between nodes of the environment and port _4848_ for external services through the shared load balancer. The HTTP basic auth is used in both cases (password can be reset using the **Reset Password** button).

All the interconnection configurations are done automatically - the solution is ready for usage out-of-the-box and does not need any manual configuration. Access to OpenSearch Dashboard is available by the same credentials as for the OpenSearch node.

Data Prepper APM is coming
==========================

The next version of our OpenSearch service will see the appearance of observability modules with Data Prepper, trace analytics bringing OpenTelemetry standard compatibility. As usual, the deployment will be done in one click though our wizard.

Pay per Use
===========

The pricing model of Hidora is different from other cloud vendor. At Hidora, you pay only what you consume!

For example, you have created a 16Gb of RAM server, and you application consume only 2Gb of memory, you will pay only for 2Gb.

During peak loads, Hidora allocates more resources for applications and takes them back when they are no longer needed.
