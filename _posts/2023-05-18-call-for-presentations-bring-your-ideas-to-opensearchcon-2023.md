The [call for presentations](https://opensearch.org/opensearchcon2023-cfp.html) for OpenSearchCon 2023 is now live! OpenSearchCon will be held in Seattle, Sept. 28, 2023 at the Sheraton Grand Seattle hotel! This yearâ€™s conference dedicates three tracks to topics the OpenSearch community cares about. We invite you to submit your best ideas for any of the following topics:

**Search**: Connect with other search and relevance practitioners with demos, deep dives, or new and novel techniques for building rich search applications. 

**Analytics, Security, and Observability:** Deploying observability tools at scale? Using OpenSearch to turn log data into insights, or to help protect your infrastructure? We want to hear from you!

**Community**: Engage a community of builders on a topic that means something to you. Anything that might educate and inspire a community of open source technologists is up for consideration here.

The call for presentations **closes June 16,** so we encourage you to get your submissions in soon.

The [call for presentations page](https://opensearch.org/opensearchcon2023-cfp.html) has more details and a link to the submission form. If you have any questions, please reach out to us at [opensearchcon@amazon.com](mailto:opensearchcon@amazon.com)
