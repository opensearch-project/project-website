Join us on Monday, October 19th at 10am Pacific (UTC-7) on [Zoom](https://www.meetup.com/OpenSearch/events/thmcwrybcnbzb/) for our biweekly community meeting.

Our focus topics will be:

* Roundup of Elasticsearch announcements from recent events
* The upcoming ODFE-CLI

As always, we will go over the Open Distro for Elasticsearch roadmap and leave plenty of time for questions and answers.

All are welcome to [join us](https://www.meetup.com/OpenSearch/events/thmcwrybcnbzb/)!
