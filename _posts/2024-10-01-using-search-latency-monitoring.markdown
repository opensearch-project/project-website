---
Responsiveness is core to any search solution, and communication delays between search requests and responses can present problems for your users. This is why many administrators monitor search latency: the amount of time between when a search request is sent to an OpenSearch cluster and when a response is returned. 

However, the ability to monitor search latency in OpenSearch versions earlier than 2.11 is limited. Tools such as the [Nodes Stats API](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/api-reference/nodes-apis/nodes-stats/) and [shard slow logs](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/install-and-configure/configuring-opensearch/logs/#shard-slow-logs) offer latency measurements based on shard-level operations but do not provide any visibility at the coordinator node level. Because search requests often hit multiple shards simultaneously, the measured amount of time spent in a single shard search phase doesn't provide comprehensive latency information.

Luckily, in OpenSearch 2.11 and later, OpenSearch offers search latency monitoring at the coordinator node level. This blog post provides information about several tools---the Node Stats API, the `phase_took` parameter, and search request slow logs---that can help you monitor coordinator-node-level statistics.

## The coordinator node and search phases

In OpenSearch, the coordinator node plays a crucial role in search execution by acting as an intermediary between the client and data nodes. When a search request is received, the coordinator node fans the request to data nodes containing the relevant shards. Depending on the type of search, the request undergoes a series of search phases, or types of search operations, initiated by the coordinator node. These phases include the following:

* `can_match`: Pre-filters search shards based on query rewrites.
* `dfs_pre_query`: Collects additional information from each shard to make scoring 100% accurate.
* `dfs_query` – Executes distributed searches with pre-collected distributed frequencies for all search terms in the search request.
* `query` – Runs query and gets information about the matching documents, such as document IDs, score, and sort criterion, from each shard.
* `fetch` – Gets the actual top matching documents after reducing all matches in the `query` phase. The top matches are returned.
* `expand` – Collapses fields on the inner hits when `expand` is enabled.

The following diagram shows the search phase workflow, from request to response.

## New features for phase monitoring

Before OpenSearch 2.11, OpenSearch only monitored the `query` and `fetch` shard search phases, greatly limiting the scope of search latency visibility. Now you can take advantage of the following features, some within preexisting APIs and tools, to monitor metrics for all search phases at the coordinator node level.

### Nodes Stats API

Introduced in OpenSearch 2.11, the [Nodes Stats API](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/api-reference/nodes-apis/nodes-stats/) can measure the following coordinator-node-level metrics. 

|Metric	|Description	|
|---	|---	|
|`time_in_millis`	|The cumulative time spent on all coordinator search operations, in milliseconds	|
|`current`	|The cumulative number of coordinator search operations that are currently running	|
|`total`	|The cumulative number of completed coordinator search operations	|

The following Nodes Stats API response shows these metrics for each search phase:

```json
GET /_nodes/stats/indices/search
{
  "_nodes": {
    "total": 6,
    "successful": 6,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "cluster_name": "113389760531:os213-2",
  "nodes": {
    "PYR526iKRq6wuuxNZJa7Zg": {
      "timestamp": 1718916559344,
      "name": "ca9a0681a452f388df882cdffc18fbfb",
      "roles": [
        "ingest",
        "master",
        "remote_cluster_client"
      ],
      "indices": {
        "search": {
          ...
          "request":  {
  "dfs_pre_query":  {
  "time_in_millis": 47,
  "current": 0,
  "total": 41
  },
  "query":  {
  "time_in_millis":  5429,
  "current":  13,
  "total":  238
  },
  "fetch":  {
  "time_in_millis":  1230,
  "current":  2,
  "total":  238
  },
  "dfs_query":  {
  "time_in_millis":  0,
  "current":  0,
  "total":  0
  },
  "expand":  {
  "time_in_millis":  304,
  "current": 1,
  "total": 238
  },
  "can_match":  {
  "time_in_millis":  0,
  "current":  0,
  "total":  0
  }
  }
        }
      }
    },
    ...
  }
```

### Search phase took time

Introduced in OpenSearch 2.12, the `phase_took` parameter returns phase took times directly in the search response, as shown in the following example:

```json
GET /my-index-000001/_search?phase_took
{
  "took" : 105,
  "phase_took" : {
    "dfs_pre_query" : 0,
    "query" : 69,
    "fetch" : 22,
    "dfs_query" : 0,
    "expand" : 4,
    "can_match" : 0
  },
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 5,
    "successful" : 5,
    "skipped" : 0,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : {
    "value" : 0,
    "relation" : "eq"
  },
  "max_score" : null,
  "hits" : [ ]
}
```

### Search request slow logs

Introduced in OpenSearch 2.12, search request slow logs provide statistics about search requests that exceed user-defined latency thresholds, as shown in the `opensearch_index_search_slowlog.log` example file:

```json
[2023-10-30T15:47:42,630][TRACE][c.s.r.slowlog] [runTask-0] 
took[80.8ms], 
took_millis[80], 
phase_took_millis[{expand=0, query=39, fetch=22}], 
total_hits[4 hits], search_type[QUERY_THEN_FETCH], 
shards[{total: 10, successful: 10, skipped: 0, failed: 0}], 
source[{"query":{"match_all":{"boost":1.0}}}], 
id[]
```

For more information about how to set up slow log thresholds, see [Search request slow logs](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/install-and-configure/configuring-opensearch/logs/#search-request-slow-logs).

## Enabling search latency monitoring

To enable these features, visit the [Search settings](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/install-and-configure/configuring-opensearch/search-settings/) page in the OpenSearch documentation or use the following example API request:

TIP: Search request slow log thresholds can be customized. This simplifies setting thresholds for certain search requests, since you can set the log creation to match the search threshold.

```json
PUT _cluster/settings
{
  "persistent" : {
    // Coordinator nodes stats
    "search.request_stats_enabled" : "true",
    // Search phase took time
    "search.phase_took_enabled" : "true",
    // Search request slow log and thresholds
    "cluster.search.request.slowlog.level" : "TRACE",
    "cluster.search.request.slowlog.threshold.warn": "10s",
    "cluster.search.request.slowlog.threshold.info": "5s",
    "cluster.search.request.slowlog.threshold.debug": "2s",
    "cluster.search.request.slowlog.threshold.trace": "10ms"
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

These new features help provide better end-to-end visibility of search latency inside your cluster. By using these tools, you can better debug spikes in request times, identify bottlenecks, and isolate the longest-running queries on your domain.
