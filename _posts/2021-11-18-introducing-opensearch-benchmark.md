We would like to introduce OpenSearch Benchmark - a community driven, open source fork of [Rally](https://esrally.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). The mission of the project is to provide a convenient and reliable performance testing framework for the OpenSearch. OpenSearch Benchmark intends to be compatible with OpenSearch and Amazon OpenSearch Service. OpenSearch Benchmark is currently in alpha release and will be maintained under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (ALv2). 

#### Why is this important for the OpenSearch community?
As a user of OpenSearch you probably want to understand how various workloads perform across different settings, host types, and cluster configurations. OpenSearch Benchmark will enable you to use resources efficiently at optimal cost. A performance testing mechanism also empowers you to run periodic benchmarks which can be used to identify performance regressions and improve performance. These underline the need to have a performance testing mechanism for OpenSearch.

#### Sounds interesting? Here’s what you can do!
We encourage you to join us and be a part of the growing OpenSearch Benchmark community! Please install [OpenSearch Benchmark](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-benchmark/blob/main/README.md#installing-benchmark) and download the source [here](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-benchmark/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). We’d like you to participate in the ongoing discussions and if you want to request any changes(bugs, feature requests), please create an issue [here](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-benchmark/issues/new/choose).

If you’re interested in contributing to the project, we’d be more than happy to welcome you. There’s already a curated set of issues with the tag [help wanted](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-benchmark/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) that you can get started on right away!
