For the past two years, we were lucky enough to hold OpenSearchCon in Seattle. Every year has brought new topics to be discussed among the community, new speakers who share interesting projects they’ve been working on, and new areas of growth for the project and the community. But one question kept coming up: When is OpenSearchCon coming to Europe? On May 6th and 7th, we had the opportunity to do just that, as we held the first [OpenSearchCon Europe](https://opensearch.org/events/opensearchcon/2024/europe/index.html) in the wonderful city of Berlin.

The call for presentations brought in more than 70 submissions for 23 available sessions—the panelists in the anonymous judging process had their work cut out for them as they evaluated submissions. The OpenSearch community delivered an exceptional collection of ideas across a wide range of topics; truth be told, we wish we had enough time during the conference to put every proposal on the stage.

The OpenSearch community gathered at Cafe Moskau in the city of Berlin to interact with and learn from one another. Attendees began the conference with a partner roundtable, which allowed partners of the project to speak with team members and fellow professionals who build on the OpenSearch platform. Eleven project [partners](https://opensearch.org/partners/) also hosted booths to engage with community members, demonstrate their unique offerings, and build connections with prospective users and contributors.

We held another [Unconference](https://opensearch.org/events/opensearchcon/2024/europe/unconference/index.html), which has become a fun and interactive part of OpenSearchCon each year. The attendees proposed a number of 15-minute talks, voted on as a community to see who would take the stage and enjoy an engaging and thought-provoking exchange of ideas.

The conference tracks, “Analytics, Security, & Observability”, “Search”, “Operating OpenSearch”, and “Community”, provided a wide array of topics that kept the audience engaged and asking questions throughout the show. 

For the keynote, OpenSearch General Manager, Mukul Karnik, and SAP Product Owner, Hariharan Gandhi, gave an inspiring look at how the community is harnessing OpenSearch’s expanding toolkit and generative AI capabilities to drive the next wave of search, analytics, observability, and security workloads.

We would like to say thank you to the volunteers that helped throughout the conference. And a special thank you to our partner [Plain Schwarz](https://plainschwarz.com/) for their tremendous help putting this event together and ensuring it was a success for the OpenSearch community. 

Seeing the community continue to support the expansion of OpenSearch and OpenSearchCon across the globe is inspiring, and we thank you for building this with us.
