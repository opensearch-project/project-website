With re:Invent right around the corner, I want to share a few of the OpenSearch sessions that are going to be particularly interesting. Some sessions pretain to open-source OpenSearch or the Amazon OpenSearch Service, but both should be applicable no matter how you run OpenSearch.

# 1. OPN311 - Extending OpenSearch

Time: Nov. 27, 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM (PST)
<br>Location: [Wynn, Level 1, Palmer 2](https://hub.reinvent.awsevents.com/attendee-portal/catalog/?search=OPN311)

Stephen Crawford and Daniel Doubrovkine (or DB) dive into how you can extend OpenSearch. If you are looking to create an extension, register a step for a search or ingestion pipeline, or are building your own plugin, this chalk talk will help you get started!

# 2. ANT312 - Using Amazon OpenSearch Service as a vector database for gen AI apps

Time: Nov. 30, 11:30 AM - 1:30 PM (PST)
<br>Location: [Caesars Forum, Level 1, Forum 118](https://hub.reinvent.awsevents.com/attendee-portal/catalog/?search=ANT312)

All anyone wants to discuss anymore is Generative AI. Well we have you covered here as well! In this session Arun Lakshmanan and Jianwei Li will walk you through how to use OpenSearch as a context store for your Generative AI applications! They will walk you through what tools OpenSearch provides to build a comprehensive solution with Generative AI.

# 3. OPN202 - Logging with Amazon EKS, Bottlerocket, Fluent Bit, and OpenSearch

Time: Nov. 29, 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM (PST)
<br>Location: [Venetian, Level 3, Murano 3203](https://hub.reinvent.awsevents.com/attendee-portal/catalog/?search=OPN202)

I am excited to be running this workshop with Kyle Davis, Senior Developer Advocate for Bottlerocket. We will cover how you can do observability on a shell-less cluster. You will deploy an EKS cluster onto nodes running Bottlerocket, a security hardened container focused operating system. Then we will deploy OpenSearch and Fluent Bit to do observability on our cluster. This is an end to end workshop with no prior experience required so we hope to see you there!

# 4. ANT210 - Improve your search with vector capabilities in OpenSearch Service

Time: Nov. 30, 2:30 PM - 3:30 PM (PST)
<br>Location: [Caesars Forum, Level 1, Summit 201](https://hub.reinvent.awsevents.com/attendee-portal/catalog/?search=ANT210)

Did you know that OpenSearch is not just a vector database but 3 vector databases in one? With OpenSearch you can leverage vector stores like FAISS, nmslib, and Lucenes Vector Store. In this session Achal Kumar from Intuit along with Aruna Govindaraju and Jon Handler from AWS will talk through how to get more relevant search results with OpenSearch as a vector store. Additionally, you will get to hear first hand how Intuit is using Amazon OpenSearch Service to get more relevant results.

# 5. COM310 - Processing over 450 million events per day in real time with AWS

Time: Nov. 27, 5:30 PM - 5:50 PM (PST)
<br>Location: [Venetian, Level 2, Hall B, Expo, Booth #1480, Theater 3](https://hub.reinvent.awsevents.com/attendee-portal/catalog/?search=COM310)

As an observability solution, OpenSearch scales! Hear from Neylson Crepalde at A3Data how they are doing observability on a whopping 5Tb per month of logs. He will cover the architecture used and many of their learnings along the way.

# 6. ANT301 - What’s new in Amazon OpenSearch Service

Time: Nov. 30, 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM (PST)
<br>Locations:

And saving the best for last; make sure you checkout live what is new in the Amazon OpenSearch Service! This session hosted by Mukul (GM of Search Services at AWS), Carl (Director of OpenSearch at AWS), and Bill Burket (Engineering Leader at EA), covers many of the new things that are going to make your experience building on OpenSearch even better! You are not going to want to miss this session.

# Other things to see

While those are some ways to learn from those using and building OpenSearch there are several other ways to connect as well! You will be able to find many experts at The OpenSearch Project booth (#105) and in the Modern Apps booth (#1390). Can’t wait to catch up with everyone there and if you’d like to chat about OpenSearch feel free to reach out to me on our [public slack](https://opensearch.org/slack.html)!
