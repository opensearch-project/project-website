### Call for papers: Bring your ideas to OpenSearchCon 2023!

The [call for papers](https://opensearch.org/opensearchcon2023-cfp.html)for OpenSearchCon 2023 is now live! This yearâ€™s conference dedicates three tracks to topics the OpenSearch community cares about. We invite you to submit your submit your best ideas for these tracks (or: for any of the following topics):

**Search**: Connect with other search and relevance practitioners with demos, deep dives, or new and novel techniques for building rich search applications. 

**Analytics, Security, and Observability:** Deploying observability tools at scale? Using OpenSearch to turn log data into insights, or to help protect your infrastructure? We want to hear from you!

**Community**: Engage a community of builders on a topic that means something to you. Anything that might educate and inspire a community of open search technologists is up for consideration here.

The call for papers **closes June 9,** so we encourage you to get your submissions in soon.

The [call for papers page](https://opensearch.org/opensearchcon2023-cfp.html) has more details and a link to the submission form. If you have any questions, please reach out to us at [opensearchcon@amazon.com](mailto:opensearchcon@amazon.com)
