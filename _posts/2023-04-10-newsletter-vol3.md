## What’s New?

**OpenSearch Slack Launch:** The OpenSearch public slack instance [launched](https://opensearch.org/blog/slack-workspace/) and is now live. Join the channel to collaborate with the OpenSearch community.

**OpenSearch-Benchmark 0.2.0 with python 3.10, 3.11 support [release](https://pypi.org/project/opensearch-benchmark/):** This is the first release of OSB since it was forked from ESRally.  It includes several fixes and is now available on Docker/ECR as well. After a long hiatus, there is substantial engagement and activity on this project.

**OpenSearch 1.3.9 has been [released](https://opensearch.org/versions/opensearch-1-3-9.html) with Debian support.**

**The College Contributor Initiative (CCI) raised 111 PRs:** The first batch of 100 college contributors last week started onboarding the second batch of 190 new college contributors.

**OpenSearch SDK integrated a framework to permit plugins and extensions to trigger actions on other extensions:** This enables key plugin features such as Job Scheduler executing scheduled jobs on Extensions.

**OpenSearch High Level Python Client (opensearch-dsl-py) has been merged into OpenSearch Python Client (opensearch-py) from [version 2.2.0 of the opensearch-py client](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-py/releases/tag/v2.2.0):** The opensearch-dsl-py was deprecated from its 2.1.0 release. This will help keep improvements synced across both high-level and low-level clients.
