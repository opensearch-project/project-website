**The College Contributor Initiative (CCI) raised 111 PRs:** The first batch of 100 college contributors last week started onboarding the second batch of 190 new college contributors.

**OpenSearch SDK integrated a framework to permit plugins and extensions to trigger actions on other extensions:** This enables key plugin features such as Job Scheduler executing scheduled jobs on Extensions.
