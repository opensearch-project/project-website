# Beta Announcement

We are excited to release the OpenSearch Beta 1.0 (derived from Elasticsearch 7.10.2) and OpenSearch Dashboards Beta 1.0 (derived from Kibana 7.10.2). With this beta release, we will have refactored all Open Distro for Elasticsearch plugins to work with OpenSearch and provide the community with downloadable artifacts to run OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards with these plugins installed. As always, all of the software in the OpenSearch project is released under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (ALv2).


### Artifacts
For beta, the downloadable artifacts will include Docker images and Linux tars. We chose to focus on Docker and Linux tars for beta as they make up over 90% of downloads on Open Distro for Elasticsearch. It is also worth noting that we have left the original plugin repos in GitHub so that customers using Open Distro for Elasticsearch can access older versions.
