---

OpenSearch is an Apache 2.0--licensed open-source project supported by an engaged community of users across the globe. Building on its commitment to openness and growth, OpenSearch recently became part of the newly formed [OpenSearch Software Foundation](https://foundation.opensearch.org/), a community-driven initiative under the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/). This shift has allowed us to enhance the developer experience by expanding platform and architecture support, especially for developers using macOS ARM64 machines. Previously, setting up an OpenSearch cluster and running integration tests required a Linux environment or Docker containers, adding complexity and overhead to the process. Now you can run and test OpenSearch plugins natively on macOS, simplifying workflows and reducing development time.

We're excited to announce that the OpenSearch core snapshot tarball artifact, built specifically for macOS ARM64 machines, is now publicly available. If you're developing on these machines, especially the latest Mac computers with Apple silicon, we encourage you to give it a try.

In this blog post, we'll discuss accessing the new snapshot artifact and using it to streamline your OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards development workflow.


## Prerequisite

You can use the artifact described in this post on a [Mac computer with Apple silicon](https://support.apple.com/en-us/116943) (ARM64 architecture). For older models with an Intel processor, you can use the [OpenSearch core snapshot artifact for macOS X64 Host](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/issues/2216).


## Download the artifact and start an OpenSearch cluster

You can download the artifact tarball through one of the following links:

- [1.3.19 snapshot artifact](https://artifacts.opensearch.org/snapshots/core/opensearch/1.3.19-SNAPSHOT/opensearch-min-1.3.19-SNAPSHOT-darwin-arm64-latest.tar.gz)

- [2.16.0 snapshot artifact](https://artifacts.opensearch.org/snapshots/core/opensearch/2.16.0-SNAPSHOT/opensearch-min-2.16.0-SNAPSHOT-darwin-arm64-latest.tar.gz)

- [3.0.0 snapshot artifact](https://artifacts.opensearch.org/snapshots/core/opensearch/3.0.0-SNAPSHOT/opensearch-min-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT-darwin-arm64-latest.tar.gz)

Our pipeline is configured to publish new artifact versions whenever they become available.

To start the cluster, run the following commands:

```bash
# Download 3.0.0 core snapshot
wget https://artifacts.opensearch.org/snapshots/core/opensearch/3.0.0-SNAPSHOT/opensearch-min-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT-darwin-arm64-latest.tar.gz

# Extract the tarball
tar -xzvf opensearch-min-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT-darwin-arm64-latest.tar.gz

# Start the cluster
cd opensearch-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT
./bin/opensearch
```

Once the cluster is started, you can make a test API call to verify that the cluster is working:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9200
```

The response should appear similar to the following:

```json
{
  "name" : "macos-arm64-host",
  "cluster_name" : "opensearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "hOcgbBtrTU-yy48nSvRj5Q",
  "version" : {
    "distribution" : "opensearch",
    "number" : "3.0.0-SNAPSHOT",
    "build_type" : "tar",
    "build_hash" : "3db252541cc843eb405c6dbb7c42712d3d612146",
    "build_date" : "2024-08-12T01:52:54.244207Z",
    "build_snapshot" : true,
    "lucene_version" : "9.12.0",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "2.17.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "2.0.0"
  },
  "tagline" : "The OpenSearch Project: https://opensearch.org/"
}
```

## Run OpenSearch plugin integration tests 

Follow this procedure to run integration tests for an OpenSearch plugin. In this example, you'll run tests for the [OpenSearch Alerting plugin](https://github.com/opensearch-project/alerting) on an M1 MacBook.

Clone the alerting repository and change directory to the repository root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opensearch-project/alerting.git
cd alerting
```

First, try running integration tests on an older version of OpenSearch that doesn't contain the core snapshot for macOS ARM64 (in this example, 2.14.0):

```bash
# Check out 2.14
git checkout 2.14

# Run integration test
./gradlew integTest
```

The tests fail with the following error:

```bash
> Task :alerting:integTest FAILED

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:

Deprecated Gradle features were used in this build, making it incompatible with Gradle 9.0.

You can use '--warning-mode all' to show the individual deprecation warnings and determine if they come from your own scripts or plugins.

For more on this, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.5/userguide/command_line_interface.html#sec:command_line_warnings in the Gradle documentation.

BUILD FAILED in 1m 31s

```

Then switch to the 2.16.0 version, in which the macOS ARM64 snapshot is available, and try again:

```bash
# Check out 2.16
git checkout 2.16

# Run integration test
./gradlew integTest
```

Integration tests are running:

```bash

**Note**: Running integration tests with the new artifact also works for OpenSearch version 1.3.19 (when you switch to the 1.3 branch) or version 3.0.0 and later (when you switch to the main branch).

## Simplify your OpenSearch Dashboards development experience

If you're developing for OpenSearch Dashboards, this release brings significant benefits. OpenSearch Dashboards relies on a running instance of OpenSearch as its backend. With this update, you can now easily configure the cluster using the following commands:

```bash
# Clone OpenSearch-Dashboards repository
git clone https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards.git
cd OpenSearch-Dashboards

# Bootstrap
yarn osd bootstrap

# Run OpenSearch backend
yarn opensearch snapshot
```

The output verifies that the latest 3.0.0 snapshot version of OpenSearch is installed and started:

```bash
yarn run v1.22.22
$ scripts/use_node scripts/opensearch snapshot

```

Now that OpenSearch is running in the background, you can start developing OpenSearch Dashboards on your macOS ARM64 host.
