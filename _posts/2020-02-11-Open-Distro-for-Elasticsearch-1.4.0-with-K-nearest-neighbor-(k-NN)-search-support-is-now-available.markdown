We are happy to announce the release of Open Distro for Elasticsearch 1.4.0. Version 1.4.0 includes the upstream open source versions of Elasticsearch 7.4.2, Kibana 7.4.2 and the latest updates for the alerting, SQL, security, performance analyzer and Kibana plugins. We are also pleased to announce the general availability of Open Distro for Elasticsearch k-NN plugin, and installer for Windows deployments. We would like to thank the community for their contributions and support in testing out the new features.  Here are the full [release notes](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/opendistro-build/blob/master/release-notes/opendistro-for-elasticsearch-release-notes-1.4.0.md). 

## Download the latest packages

You can find Docker Hub images [Open Distro for Elasticsearch 1.4.0](https://hub.docker.com/r/amazon/opendistro-for-elasticsearch) and [Open Distro for Elasticsearch Kibana 1.4.0](https://hub.docker.com/r/amazon/opendistro-for-elasticsearch-kibana) on Docker Hub. Make sure your compose file specifies 1.4.0 or uses the latest tag. See our documentation on how to install Open Distro for Elasticsearch with [RPMs](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/install/rpm/) and install Open Distro for Elasticsearch with [Debian packages](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/install/deb/). With [Windows exe](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/install/windows/) supporting version 1.4.0, users can now easily install Elasticsearch and Kibana on Windows and run it as a service. You can find our Open Distro for Elasticsearch security plugin artifacts on [Maven Central](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.amazon.opendistroforelasticsearch). You can download the latest versions of Open Distro for Elasticsearch’s [PerfTop client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws/opendistro-for-elasticsearch-perftop), and Open Distro for Elasticsearch’s [SQL JDBC driver](https://d3g5vo6xdbdb9a.cloudfront.net/downloads/elasticsearch-clients/opendistro-sql-jdbc/opendistro-sql-jdbc-0.9.0.0.jar).

Note:  k-NN plugin is only available as part of docker image in this release.


## New Features

### k-NN plugin

Our new k-NN search plugin enables high scale, low latency nearest neighbor search on billions of documents across thousands of dimensions with the same ease as running any regular Elasticsearch query. Built using the [Non-Metric Space Library](https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib) (NMSLIB), this plugin can power use cases such as product recommendations, fraud detection, and image, video, and related document search. We have extended the Apache Lucene codec to introduce a new file format to store vector data. k-NN Search uses the standard Elasticsearch mapping and query syntax —to designate a field as a k-NN vector you can simply map it to the new k-NN field type provided by the k-NN plugin. k-NN functionality integrates seamlessly with other Elasticsearch features. This provides users  the flexibility to use Elasticsearch’s extensive search features such as
aggregations and filtering with k-NN to further improve the search results. Learn more at [k-NN](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/k-NN)



## Packages and features under development

### Anomaly Detection

Machine learning based anomaly detection has been released as an alpha plugin and is under active development. The anomaly detection feature can handle large volumes of high dimensional data and detect outliers in real-time. The anomaly detection feature depends on the underlying [Random Cut Forest](https://github.com/aws/random-cut-forest-by-aws) (RCF) library, a proven algorithm for streaming use cases. RCF is also now open source  and provides better visibility into the anomaly detection decision framework.  

### Performance Analyzer Root Cause Analysis (RCA) framework

The Performance Analyzer RCA is a framework that builds on the Performance Analyzer engine to support Root Cause Analysis (RCA) of performance and reliability problems in Elasticsearch clusters. This framework executes real time root cause analyses using Performance Analyzer metrics. You can now weigh in your feedback on the [design proposal](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/performance-analyzer/blob/master/rca/rfc-rca.pdf) released recently.
