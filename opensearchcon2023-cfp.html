  <div class="intro">
    <p>
      The OpenSearchCon 2023 call for papers is now live! Our second annual OpenSearch conference will educate current and future users about the many ways the community builds with OpenSearch and share the impact of your OpenSearch-powered applications and environments.
      <br><br>
      This year’s conference program is divided across three tracks to reflect the interests of our community. Feel free to submit as many ideas as you like. We will accept a maximum of two talks per person in two different tracks. These are the tracks and the types of sessions we’re looking for.

    <h1>Search</h1>

    <p class="indented">This track is for search and relevance practitioners. Whether you have used OpenSearch in production for your search workloads or you have an interesting demo with OpenSearch, we’d love to know about it! Topics of particular interest include deep dives into search, novel techniques for delivering better relevance, how you are augmenting search with vectors, and even forward-looking talks about future efforts to improve the search experience with OpenSearch.</p>

    <h1>Analytics, Security, and Observability:</h1>

    <p class="indented">We see OpenSearch used heavily in analytics, security, and observability applications. Here we’d like to see you talking about solving issues at scale with OpenSearch! What enabled your success and how can others achieve the same outcomes? How are you using OpenSearch to protect your organization’s infrastructure? What strange things are you doing with OpenSearch that might inspire others? Real-world examples are going to shine the brightest here. </p>

    <h1>Community</h1>

    <p class="indented">One of the wonderful things about working in open source is the backing of a community of people who believe in our mission. With this track we’d love to hear your talks about how to contribute to OpenSearch or open source, how to foster community engagement, how to build the next generation of open source leaders — virtually anything that inspires a community of open source technology enthusiasts is open for consideration here!</p>
