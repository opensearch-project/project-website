This presentation will cover the process of converting the OpenSearch Security Repository to an open-access model. This change saw the Security Repository become the first repository to host open-to-the-public triaging meetings and has led to increased community engagement. Audience members can expect to learn more about OpenSearch's efforts to engage with the community, how to transition into similar models, and the benefits of this shift.
