ZStandard is a compression algorithm that provides a balance between high compression ratios and fast decompression speeds. In this talk, we will present a comparative performance analysis of this new compression algorithm for OpenSearch against the existing ones, lz4 and deflate. We'll also highlight and demonstrate how OpenSearch performance can be further boosted by using on-die hardware accelerators for compression. Finally, we will discuss our experience benchmarking OpenSearch using OpenSearch-Benchmark.
