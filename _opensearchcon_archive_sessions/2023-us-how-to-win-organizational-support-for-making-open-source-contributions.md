While many use open source projects like OpenSearch, few users contribute back to the community. The transition from user to contributor often needs business managers' support. This talk explains why open source contributions are beneficial for business, setting reasonable expectations and goals, and tackling common objections. Examples from KMW Technology's 13-year experience in search and facilitating companies' contributions to open source will be provided.
