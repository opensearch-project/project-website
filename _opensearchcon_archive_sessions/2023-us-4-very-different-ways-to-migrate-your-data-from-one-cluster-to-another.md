Data migration, an often encountered task in managing OpenSearch in production, can be complex when managing data at scale. This talk discusses four diverse methods to migrate data between clusters: Cross Cluster Replication, Snapshot/Restore, Reindexing, and a method known as “The Node Toss”. We explore what happens “under the hood”, weigh the pros and cons of each approach, and suggest when each method should be employed.
