This presentation will explore advancements in OpenSearch, an open-source platform for log analytics and observability. Topics will include the integration of OpenSearch with Prometheus, the support for tracing standards like OpenTelemetry (OTel) and Jaeger, and compatibility with the OpenTelemetry exporter. We will also discuss the recent low-cost log analytics feature and its impact on the industry. Finally, we'll discuss the new benchmarking framework based on oteldemo for performance comparison and optimization.
